	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.17.0
	
2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/bugs: Gone. Separate plugin package.
	* twisted/eco: Gone. The king is dead. Long live the king!
	(eco is no longer going to be developed, Pyrex has obviated it.)

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/irc.py: Some fix-ups to IRCClient and
	DccFileReceive, from Joe Jordan (psy).

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality: Gone. This is now in a completely separate plugin
	package.
	
2002-04-09  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

        * win32 process support seems to *finally* be working correctly. Many
        thanks to Drew Whitehouse for help with testing and debugging.

2002-04-08  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

        * coil refactored yet again, this time to use components and adapters.
        The design is now much cleaner.

2002-04-08  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/jelly.py: Refactored jelly to provide (a) more
	sane, language-portable API for efficient extensibility and (b)
	final version of "wire" protocol.  This should be very close to
	the last wire-protocol-breaking change to PB before
	standardization happens.

2002-04-04  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Removed __getattr__ backwards compatibility in PB

2002-04-03  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/usage.py, twisted/test/test_usage.py, bin/mktap, twisted/tap/*.py:
	Made the usage.Options interface better -- options are now stored in the
	'opts' dict. This is backwards compatible, and I added a deprecation warning.

2002-04-01  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.16.0.

2002-03-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added Qt event loop support, written by Sirtaj Singh Kang and
	Aleksandar Erkalovic.

2002-03-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added a 'coil' command for configuring TAP files

2002-03-15  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* XML-RPC published methods can now return Deferreds, and Twisted
	will Do The Right Thing.

2002-03-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Refactored coil, the configuration mechanism for Twisted.
	See twisted.coil and twisted.coil.plugins for examples of how
	to use the new interface. Chris Armstrong did some UI improvements
	for coil as well.

	* Checked in win32 Process support, and fixed win32 event loop.

2002-03-11  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@janus.twistedmatrix.com>

	* More robust shutdown sequence for default mainloop (other
	mainloops should follow suit, but they didn't implement shutdown
	callbacks properly before anyway...).  This allows for shutdown
	callbacks to continue using the main loop.

2002-03-09  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Automatic log rotation for twistd. In addition, sending SIGUSR1
	to twistd will rotate the log.

2002-03-07  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.15.5.

2002-03-06  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/html.py: Got rid of html.Interface. This was a really
	old, really deprecated API.

2002-03-06  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/widgets.py: Deprecated usage of Gadget.addFile(path)
	and replaced it with Gadget.putPath(path, pathname). This is
	a lot more flexible.

2002-03-05  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/win32.py: New win32 event loop, written by
	Andrew Bennetts.

	* twisted/tap/*: Changed the interface for creating tap modules - use
	a method called updateApplication instead of getPorts. this
	is a much more generic and useful mechanism.

	* twisted/internet/task.py: Fixed a bug where the schedular wasn't
	installed in some cases.

2002-03-04  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/server.py: authorizer.Unauthorized->util.Unauthorized
	(leftovers from removing .passport references.)

	* twisted/names/dns.py: Added support for TTL.

2002-03-02  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.15.4.

2002-03-02  Paul Shwartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py: Send End-Of-MOTD message --
	some clients rely on this for automatic joining of channels
	and whatnot.

2002-03-02  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/names/dns.py: Fixed bugs in DNS client

2002-03-01  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing 0.15.3.

2002-02-27  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/mail/*, twisted/plugins.tml: The Mail server is now
	COILable.

	* bin/twistd: security fix: use a secure umask (077, rather than 0)
	for twistd.pid.

2002-02-26  Allen Short  <washort@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco/eco.py, twisted/eco/sexpy.py: ECO now supports
	backquoting and macros.

2002-02-26  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/ftp.py, twisted/plugins.tml: Made the FTP
	server COILable!

2002-02-26  Benjamin Bruheim  <phed@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/distrib.py: Fixed a win32-compatibility bug.

2002-02-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/socks.py: Made SOCKSv4 coilable, and fixed a
	bug so it'd work with Mozilla.

2002-02-24  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.15.2.

2002-02-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* setup.py: Added plugins.tml and instancemessenger.glade installs
	so mktap and t-im work in a 'setup.py install' install.

	* debian/rules: Install plugins.tml so mktap works in debian installs.

	* doc/man/mktap.1, twistd.1: Updated the man pages to be more accurate.

2002-02-24  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/mktap: Better error reporting when we don't find
	the plugins files.

	* bin/twistd: Print out the *real* usage description rather than
	barfing when we get bad command line arguments.

2002-02-24  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* debian/rules: Install the instancemessenger.glade file, so IM
	will work in debian installs.

2002-02-24  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/oscar.py, socks.py, toc.py: Fixed a security
	hole in TOC where clients could call any method on the server.

2002-02-23  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/tap/coil.py: There is now a tap-creator for COIL.

	* twisted/internet/stupidproxy.py: Now with COILability!

2002-02-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/mktap: mktap now uses Plugins instead of searching through
	twisted.tap. Yay for unified configuration systems!


2002-02-22  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im, twisted/words: t-im can now do topic setting (words
	only), fixed the Group Metadata-setting interface in the service.

2002-02-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/manhole: COIL can now load Plugins.

2002-02-21  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.spread.pb: Changed remote method invocations to be
	called through .callRemote rather than implicitly by getattr, and
	added LocalAsRemote utility class for emulating remote behavior.

2002-02-21  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.ftp: Fixed a lot of serious bugs.

2002-02-20  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.telnet: the python shell now supports
	multi-line commands and can be configured using coil.

2002-02-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.lumberjack: a log rotation and viewing service.
	Currently only log rotation is supported.

2002-02-12  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py (IRCChatter.irc_AWAY): Fix bug
	where you can never come back from being away (at least using
	epic4).  Closes: #%d

2002-02-11  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/widgets.py: Changed Gadget.page to Gadget.pageFactory
	for clarity (this is backwards-compatible).

2002-02-10  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/jelly.py:
	* twisted/spread/banana.py:
	* twisted/spread/pb.py: fixed bugs found by pychecker, got rid
	of __ping__ method support, and added 'local_' methods to
	RemoteReference

	* twisted/persisted/styles.py: pychecker bug fixes

2002-02-09  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/eco: Created a command-line interpreter for ECO.

	* doc/man/eco.1: man page for bin/eco

2002-02-09  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco/eco.py: Reverted evaluator state back to functional-ness
	:) And added functions (anonymous and global), and broke various
	interfaces

2002-02-09  Allen Short  <washort@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco/eco.py: Refactored evaluator into a class, improved
	python-function argument signatures, and added and/or/not functions.

2002-02-08  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/service.py, ircservice.py: Fixed annoying PING
	bug, and added /topic support.

2002-02-08  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco: Initial prototype of ECO, the Elegant C Overlay
	macro engine.

2002-02-02  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/ircsupport.py:  Added support for the IRC protocol
	to IM.

2002-02-02  Chris Armstrong <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/deferred.py: added Deferred.addErrback, so now
	it's easy to attach errbacks to deferreds when you don't care
	about plain results.

	* twisted/im/chat.py, twisted/im/pbsupport.py: added support for
	displaying topics.

2002-02-02  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* SOCKSv4 support: there is now a protocols.socks, which contains
	support for SOCKSv4, a TCP proxying protocol.  mktap also has
	support for the new protocol.

2002-02-02  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py (IRCChatter.receiveDirectMessage),
	(IRCChatter.receiveGroupMessage),
	(IRCChatter.irc_PRIVMSG): Added CTCP ACTION <-> emote translation

2002-02-01  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/tocsupport.py: Added support for most of the TOC
	protocol to IM.


2002-02-01  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/*.py: added metadata/emote support to IM. "/me foo"
	now triggers a backwards-compatible emote.


2002-01-30  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/tcp.py: Fixed the bug where startFactory() would
	get called twice.

2002-01-30  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im: a new client for twisted.words (and eventually
	much more) based on GTK+ and Glade. This is mainly glyph's
	code, but I organized it for him to check in.

	* twisted/words/service.py: metadata support for words messages
	(only {'style': 'emote'} is standardized as of yet)

2002-01-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added hook to tcp.Port and ssl.Port for limiting acceptable
	  connections - approveConnection(socket, addr).

2002-01-27  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py: You can now change the topic
	of a channel with '/msg channelName topic <topic>' - note that
	'channelName' does *not* include the '#'.

2002-01-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* Incompatible change to PB: all remote methods now return
	Deferreds.  This doesn't break code in as many places as possible,
	but the connection methods now work differently and have different
	signatures.

	* Incompatible change to Banana: Banana now really supports floats
	and long integers.  This involved removing some nasty hackery that
	was previously part of the protocol spec, so you'll need to
	upgrade.

	* Added a feature to Jelly: Jelly now supports unicode strings.

	* Improved Twisted.Forums considerably: still needs work, but it's
	growing into an example of what you can do with a Twisted.Web
	application.

	* Added Twisted.Web.Webpassport -- generic mechanism for web-based
	login to arbitrary services.  This in conjunction with some code
	in Forum that uses it.

	* Incompatible change in Enterprise: all query methods now return
	Deferreds, as well as take arguments in an order which makes it
	possible to pass arbitrary argument lists for using the database's
	formatting characters rather than python's.

2002-01-15  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/passport.py: (and friends) Retrieval of
	perspectives is now asynchronous, hooray (this took way too long)!
	Perspectives may now be stored in external data sources.  Lurching
	slowly towards a stable API for the Passport system, along with
	Sean's recent commits of tools to manipulate it.

2002-01-14  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/explorer.py: reimplementated.  So it's better.
	And yes, I broke the API.

	* twisted/manhole/ui/spelunk_gnome.py: Less duplication of visages,
	and they're draggable now too.

2002-01-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Changed twisted.enterprise.adabi so operations can accept lists
	  of arguments. This allows us to use the database adaptor's native
	  SQL quoting ability instead of either doing it ourselves, or the
	  *current* way twisted does it (not doing it at all, AFAICT!).

	  cursor.execute("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%s, %d), "it's magic", 12)

	  Problem is that different adaptors may have different codes for
	  quoting.

	* First go at database for twisted.bugs. I hate RDBMS. I hate web.
