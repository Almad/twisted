	* twisted/internet/passport.py: (and friends) Retrieval of
	perspectives is now asynchronous, hooray (this took way too long)!
	Perspectives may now be stored in external data sources.  Lurching
	slowly towards a stable API for the Passport system, along with
	Sean's recent commits of tools to manipulate it.

	* twisted/python/explorer.py: reimplementated.  So it's better.
	And yes, I broke the API.

	* twisted/manhole/ui/spelunk_gnome.py: Less duplication of visages,
	and they're draggable now too.

	* Changed twisted.enterprise.adabi so operations can accept lists
	  of arguments. This allows us to use the database adaptor's native
	  SQL quoting ability instead of either doing it ourselves, or the
	  *current* way twisted does it (not doing it at all, AFAICT!).

	  cursor.execute("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%s, %d), "it's magic", 12)

	  Problem is that different adaptors may have different codes for
	  quoting.

	* First go at database for twisted.bugs. I hate RDBMS. I hate web.
