	trial.

2003-01-06  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/microdom.py: Added beExtremelyLenient mode (for
	parsing "tag soup").  While this isn't quite as lenient as Mozilla
	or IE's code (it will, for example, translate
	<div><i><b>foo</i>bar</b></div> to <div><i><b>foo</b></i>bar</div>
	) I am still rather proud of the wide range of complete garbage
	that it will mangle into at least reasonably similar XHTML-esque
	documents.

2003-01-05  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* twisted/internet/cReactor/*, setup.py: Implement getDelayedCalls for

	coverage for IReactorTime.getDelayedCalls
	
2002-12-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* pyunit/unittest.py (TestCase.__call__): clean the reactor between
	tests: cancel any leftover reactor.callLater() timers. This helps
	to keep deferred failures isolated to the test that caused them.

2002-12-30  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/conch/*: added docstrings to most conch classes and functions

2002-12-30  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	authentication and session management.  In particular a nice
	feature of this new code is automatic negotiation with browsers on
	whether cookies are enabled or not.

2002-12-27  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/tkconch: initial commit of tkconch, a SSH client using Tkinter
	as a terminal emulator.  puts up a menu to configure when run without
	arguments.

	* twisted/conch/ui: moved ansi.py and tkvt100.py to t.c.ui so they are
	away from the purely conch stuff.

2002-11-30  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Summary of Conch changes:  An actual client (bin/conch) which is
	mostly compatible with the OpenSSH client.  An optional C module to
	speed up some of the math operations.  A bunch of other stuff has
	changed too, but it's hard to summarize a month of work.

2002-11-24  Donovan Preston  <dp@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/woven/*: Added the beginnings of a general framework for
	asynchronously updating portions of woven pages that have already been
	sent to the browser. Added controller.LiveController, page.LivePage,
	and utils.ILivePage to contain code for dealing with keeping Views alive

	Session object on the server; code for responding to model changed
	notifications, rerendering Views that depend on those models that have
	changed; code for sending these rerendered views as html fragments to
	the browser; and javascript code to mutate the DOM of the live page
	with the updated HTML.  Mozilla only for the moment; ie to come soon.

	to widgets that fire when a given javascript event occurs in the
	browser.
	Widget.addEventHandler(self, eventName, handler, *args) and

	will dispatch to event handlers registered with addEventHandler.

2002-11-10  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing 1.0.1alpha2

	* twisted/web/static.py, twisted/tap/web.py: Changed 'mktap web'
	to use --ignore-ext .ext so that you can assign order to the
	extensions you want to ignore, and not accidentally catch bad
	extensions.

2002-11-04  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/internet/tksupport.py: new, better Tkinter integration.

	mainloop() yourself.

2002-10-25  Moshe Zadka <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/domhelpers.py twisted/python/domhelpers.py

	See doc/examples/soap.py for sample usage.

2002-10-22  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/log.py: Two new features.
	1) a stupid `debug' method that simply prefixes a message with "debug"
	and indents it so it's easier to distinguish from normal messages.
	This can eventually log to some magic "debug channel", once we have
	that implemented.

	2) implemented a custom warning handler; now warnings look sexy.
	(the hackish overriding of warnings.showwarning is the recommended way
	to do so, according to the library reference.)

2002-10-22  Moshe Zadka <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* setup.py: conditionalize cReactor on threads support too. This
	is somewhat of a hack as it it done currently, but it's only necessary
	on weird OSes like NetBSD. I assume any UNIX with thread support has
	pthreads.

	* twisted/internet/tksupport.py: tunable reactor iterate delay
	parameter [by Jp Calderone]

2002-10-17  Moshe Zadka <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	(among other applications).

2002-09-25  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/tap/manhole.py: mktap manhole will now prompt for a
	password or accept one from stdin if one is not provided on the
	command line.

	* bin/tapconvert: made sure tapconvert program gets installed.

2002-09-24  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/resource.py (Resource.wasModifiedSince): revoked,
	not adding this after all.  Instead,

	* twisted/protocols/http.py (Request.setLastModified)
	(Request.setETag): these methods to set cache validation headers
	for the request will return http.CACHED if the request is
	conditional and this setting causes the condition to fail.

	method, override this to get sensible handling of
	If-Modified-Since conditional requests.

2002-09-21  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/static.py, twisted/web/script.py: Previously, it was
	  not possible to use the same xmlmvc application (directory full
	  of files and all) to interface to separate instances in the same
	  server, without a considerable amount of hassle.  We have
	  introduced a new "Registry" object which is passed to all .rpy
	  and .epy scripts as "registry" in the namespace.  This is a
	  componentized, so it can be used to associate different
	  components for the same interface for different File instances
	  which represent the same underlying directory.

2002-09-20  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/microdom.py: You can now specify tags that the
	  parser will automatically close if they are not closed
	  immediately.  This is to support output from HTML editors which
	  will not output XML, but still have a predictable
	  almost-but-not-quite XML structure.  Specifically it has been
	  tested with Mozilla Composer.

	* twisted/spread/util.py: improved Pager

	* twisted/tap/news.py: works saner now

	* twisted/tap/ssh.py: can specify authorizer

	* twisted/words/tendril.py: lots of fixes, it works now

2002-09-17  Donovan Preston  <dp@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added better error reporting to WebMVC. To do this, I had to
	remove the use of "class" and "id" attributes on nodes as
	synonyms for "model", "view", and "controller". Overloading
	these attributes for three purposes, not to mention their
	usage by JavaScript and CSS, was just far too error-prone.

2002-09-09  Andrew Bennetts  <spiv@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.inetd: An inetd(8) replacement.  TCP support should be
	complete, but UDP and Sun-RPC support is still buggy.  This was
	mainly written as a proof-of-concept for how to do a forking
	super-server with Twisted, but is already usable.

2002-08-30  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.1rc4. There was a bug in the acquisition
	code, as well as a typo in TwistedQuotes.

2002-08-29  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.1rc3. A bug in the release script
	left .pyc files in the tarball.

2002-08-29  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.1rc2. There was a bug with circular
	imports between modules in twisted.python.

2002-08-28  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.1rc1.

2002-08-27  Donovan Preston  <dp@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.web.domtemplate: Look up templates in the directory of
	the module containing the DOMTemplate doing the lookup before
	going along with regular acquisition.

2002-08-27  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.*: Lots of minor fixes to make JavaReactor work again.

2002-08-26  Andrew Bennetts  <andrew-twisted@puzzling.org>

	* twisted.python.logfile: Added the ability to disable log
	rotation if logRotation is None.

2002-08-22  Jp Calderone  <exarkun@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.news: Added a decent RDBM storage backend.

2002-08-21  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* doc/howto/process.html: Process documentation, too!

2002-08-20  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* doc/howto/clients.html: Client-writing documentation.

2002-08-20  Jp Calderone  <exarkun@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.nntp: More protocol implemented: SLAVE, XPATH,
	XINDEX, XROVER, TAKETHIS, and CHECK.

2002-08-19  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin, twisted.scripts.*: Migrated all bin/* scripts'
	implementations to twisted/scripts. This means win32 users will
	finally have access to all of the twisted scripts through .bat
	files!

2002-08-19  Jp Calderone  <exarkun@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.news, twisted.protocols.nntp: Additional RFC977 support:
	HELP and IHAVE implemented.

2002-08-19  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.{process,win32eventreactor,etc}: New and
	hopefully final Process API, and improved Win32 GUI support.

2002-08-18  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Everything: Got rid of almost all usage of the `print' statement
	as well as any usage of stdout. This will make it easier to
	redirect boring log output and still write to stdout in your
	scripts.

2002-08-18  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0 final. No changes since rc9.

2002-08-17  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc8, with a fix to tap2deb and
	slightly updated options documentation.

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc9 with fixes to release-twisted
	and doc/howto/options.html.

2002-08-16  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc6, with some fixes to setup.py
	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc7, __init__.py fixes.

2002-08-15  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc5, with some one severe bug-fix and
	a few smaller ones.

2002-08-14  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc1! ON THE WAY TO 1.0, BABY!
	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc2! Sorry, typoed the version number in
	copyright.py
	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc3! I HATE TAGGING!
	* Releasing Twisted 0.99.0rc4, some very minor errors fixed.

2002-08-14  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet, twisted.cred: Applications and Authorizers are
	now completely decoupled, save for a tiny backwards-compatibility.

2002-08-10  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.defer, twisted.python.failure: Changes to
	Deferred and Failure to make errbacks more consistent. error
	callbacks are now *guaranteed* to be passed a Failure instance,
	no matter what was passed to Deferred.errback().

2002-08-07  Jp Calderone  <exarkun@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.python.usage: New "subcommands" feature for
	usage.Options: Now, you can have nested commands
	(`cvs commit'-style) for your usage.Options programs.

2002-08-04  Bruce Mitchener  <bruce@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet: New `writeSequence' method on transport
	objects: This can increase efficiency as compared to `write`ing
	concatenated strings, by copying less data in memory.

2002-08-02  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.cred.service, twisted.internet.app: Application/Service
	refactor: These two things should be less dependant on each other,
	now.

2002-07-31  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.issues: After weeks of hacking in the secret (Austin,
	TX) hideout with Allen Short, twisted.issues, the successor to
	Twisted Bugs, is born. Featuring a paranoia-inducing chat-bot
	interface!

2002-07-30  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.kqueue: Thanks to Matt Campbell, we now have a
	new FreeBSD KQueue Reactor.

2002-07-27  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* doc/fun/Twisted.Quotes: Added our seekrut Twisted.Quotes file to
	Twisted proper.

2002-07-26  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.spread: "Paging" for PB: this is an abstraction for
	sending big streams of data across a PB connection.


2002-07-23  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet: Rewrite of client APIs. `reactor.clientXXX'
	methods are now deprecated. See new reactor.connect*
	documentation. Also Application-level client methods have been
	reworked, see the Application documentation.

2002-07-23  Bryce Wilcox-O'Hearn  <zooko@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.zoot: Application-level implementation of Gnutella.

2002-07-21  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.im, bin/im: GUI improvements to t-im, and renamed
	bin/t-im to bin/im (and get rid of old twisted.words client).

2002-07-15  Bryce Wilcox-O'Hearn  <zooko@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.gnutella: Twisted now has an implementation of
	the Gnutella protocol.

2002-07-15  Sean Riley  <sean@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.sister: Now featuring distributed login.

2002-07-15  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.conch: A new implementation of ssh2, bringing Twisted
	one step closer to being a complete replacement of all unix
	services ;-)

2002-07-14  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.19.0! It's exactly the same as rc4.

2002-07-13  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.19.0rc4. All Known Issues in the README have
	been fixed. This will hopefully be the last release candidate for
	0.19.0.

2002-07-07  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.19.0rc3.

2002-07-07  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.19.0rc2.

2002-07-07  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Releasing Twisted 0.19.0rc1.

2002-07-07  Keith Zaback  <krz@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.cReactor: A new poll-based reactor written in
	C. This is still very experimental and incomplete.

2002-07-07  Donovan Preston  <dp@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.web.dom*: Better support in domtemplate/domwidgets etc
	for Deferreds and Widgets. Also deprecated getTemplateMethods
	method in favor of automatically looking up methods on the class
	based on the attributes found in the template. There are some
	minimal docs already, and better ones coming soon.

2002-06-26  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.process,interfaces,default: Process now
	supports SetUID: there are new UID/GID arguments to the process
	spawning methods/constructors.

2002-06-22  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.oscar: totally rewrote OSCAR protocol
	implementation.

2002-06-18  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet.defer: Deprecated the arm method of Deferred
	objects: the replacement is a pair of methods, pause and
	unpause. After the pause method is called, it is guaranteed that
	no call/errbacks will be called (at least) until unpause is
	called.

2002-06-10  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/persisted/aot.py, bin/twistd,mktap, twisted/internet/app.py:

	AOT (Abstract Object Tree) experimental source-persistence
	mechanism. This is a more-concise, easier-to-edit alternative to
	Twisted's XML persistence, for people who know how to edit Python
	code. Also added appropriate options to mktap and twistd to
	load/save .tas (Twisted Application Source) files.

	I will be working on making the formatting better, soon, but it's
	workable for now.

2002-06-08  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.internet, twisted.tap.web: Add a --https and related
	options to 'mktap web'; web is now much more SSL-friendly.


2002-06-02  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted.internet: changed protocol factory interface - it now has
	doStop and doStart which are called in reactors, not app.Application.
	This turns start/stopFactory into an implementation-specific feature,
	and also ensures they are only called once.

2002-06-01  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.18.0

2002-05-31  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/coil/plugins/portforward.py, twisted/tap/portforward.py:
	  Forgot to add these before rc1 :-) You can use the portforwarder
	  with Coil and mktap again (previously "stupidproxy")

	* twisted/web/static.py: Fixed a bunch of bugs related to redirection
	for directories.

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.18.0rc2

2002-05-30  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Twisted no longer barfs when the Python XML packages aren't available.

2002-05-29  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.18.0rc1

2002-05-25  Christopher Armstrong  <radix@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/pb.py, twisted/internet/defer.py,
	  twisted/python/failure.py, etc:

	  Perspective broker now supports Failures! This should make writing
	  robust PB clients *much* easier. What this means is that errbacks will
	  recieve instances of t.python.failure.Failure instead of just strings
	  containing the traceback -- so you can easily .trap() particular
	  errors and handle them appropriately.

2002-05-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring, Moshe Zadka <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.mail cleanups:

		* basic bounce support.

		* removed telnet from mail tap

		* mail domains now receive service in __init__

		* split file system stuff into Queue (renamed from
	          MessageCollection)

		* Put a Queue in service

	* twisted/protocol/smtp.py: changed SMTPClient API so that it returns
	a file for the message content, instead of a string.

2002-05-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Twisted applications can now be persisted to XML files (.tax) with
	the --xml option -- this is pretty verbose and needs some optimizations.

2002-05-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/persisted/marmalade.py: Marmalade: Jelly, with just a hint
	of bitterness. An XML object serialization module designed so
	people can hand-edit persisted objects (like Twisted Applications).

2002-05-21  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/internet/gtkreactor.py: GTK+ support for win32; input_add
	is not supported in win32 and had to be worked around.

2002-05-20  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/pythor/defer.py, twisted/protocols/protocol.py,
	  twisted/internet/defer.py, twisted/internet/protocol.py:

	    Moved defer and protocol to twisted.internet to straighten
	    out dependancies.

2002-05-18  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/metrics, twisted/forum: Metrics and Forum are no longer
	a part of Twisted proper; They are now in different CVS modules, and
	will be released separately.

2002-05-15  Andrew Bennetts <andrew-twisted@puzzling.org>

	* twisted/protocols/ftp.py: Small fixes to FTPClient that have
	changed the interface slightly -- return values from callbacks
	are now consistent for active and passive FTP.  Have a look at
	doc/examples/ftpclient.py for details.

2002-05-12  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* doc/specifications/banana.html: Documentation of the Banana protocol.

2002-05-06  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/gtkchat.py: Some more UI improvements to InstanceMessenger:
	Nicks are now colorful (each nick is hashed to get a color) and
	messages now have timestamps.

2002-05-04  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Reactor Refactor! Pretty much all of the twisted.internet.* classes
	are being depracated in favor of a single, central class called the
	"reactor". Interfaces are defined in twisted.internet.interfaces.
	For a much more descriptive comment about this change, see
	http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-commits/2002-May/002104.html.

2002-05-04  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/pb.py: There is now some resource limiting in PB.
	Clients can now have the number of references to an object limited.

2002-04-29  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/*: Refactored Twisted InstanceMessenger to seperate GUI
	and logic. Also improved the UI a bit.

2002-04-28  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/protocols/http.py: log hits using extended log format
	and make web taps logfile configurable.

2002-04-26  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/lumberjack/logfile.py: reversed order of rotated
	logs - higer numbers are now older.

2002-04-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* doc/examples/ircLogBot.py: We now have a sample IRC bot that logs
	all messages to a file.

2002-04-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <twisted@itamarst.org>

	* twisted/python/components.py: Twisted's interfaces are now
	more like Zope's - __implements__ is an Interface subclass
	or a tuple (or tuple of tuples). Additonally, an instance can
	implement an interface even if its class doesn't have an
	__implements__.

2002-04-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/usage.py: Minor niceties for usage.Options:
	You can now look up the options of an Options object with
	optObj['optName'], and you if you define opt_* methods with
	underscores in them, using dashes on the command line will work.

2002-04-21  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/scripts/mktap.py: No more --manhole* options, use
	'--append=my.tap manhole' now.

2002-04-20  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.17.4.

	* twisted/internet/tcp.py: Make unix domain sockets *really*
	world-accessible, rather than just accessible by "other".

2002-04-19  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/{server,twcgi}.py: Fixed POST bug in distributed
	web servers.

2002-04-19  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.17.3.

2002-04-19  Glyph Lefkowitz  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/distrib.py: Fix a bug where static.File transfers
	over a distributed-web connection would not finish up properly.

2002-04-18  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.17.2.

2002-04-18  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/news: A news server and NNTP protocol support courtesy of
	exarkun. Another step towards Twisted implementations of EVERYTHING
	IN THE WORLD!

2002-04-17  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/pb.py: Errors during jelly serialization used to
	just blow up; now they more properly return a Deferred Failure. This
	will make hangs in PB apps (most notably distributed web) less common.

2002-04-17  Donovan Preston <dp@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Major changes to the capabilities of the static web server, in an
	attempt to be able to use Twisted instead of Zope at work; my plan is to
	capture many of the conveniences of Zope without the implicitness and
	complexity that comes with working around implicit behavior when it fails.

	1) .trp and .rpy support in the static web server:
	Very simple handlers to allow you to easily add Resource objects
		dynamically to a running server, by merely changing files on the
		filesystem.
	An .rpy file will be executed, and if a "resource" variable exists upon the
		execution's completion, it will be returned.
	A .trp file (twisted resource pickle) will be unpickled and returned. An
		object unpickled from a .trp should either implement IResource itself,
		or have a registered adapter in twisted.python.components.

	2) Acquisition:
	As resources are being looked up by repeated calls to getChild, this
		change creates instances of
		twisted.spread.refpath.PathReferenceAcquisitionContext and puts
		them in the request as "request.pathRef"
	Any method that has an instance of the request can then climb up
		the parent tree using "request.pathRef['parentRef']['parentRef']
	PathReferenceAcquisitionContext instances can be dereferenced to the
		actual object using getObject
	Convenience method: "locate"   returns a PathReference to first place
		in the parent heirarchy a name is seen
	Convenience method: "acquire"  somewhat like Zope acquisition;
		mostly untested, may need fixes

	3) DOM-based templating system:
	A new templating system that allows python scripts to use the DOM
		to manipulate the HTML node tree. Loosely based on Enhydra.
	Subclasses of twisted.web.domtemplate.DOMTemplate can override
		the templateFile attribute and the getTemplateMethods method;
		ultimately, while templateFile is being parsed, the methods
		specified will be called with instances of xml.dom.mindom.Node
		as the first parameter, allowing the python code to manipulate
		(see twisted.web.blog for an example)

2002-04-17  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/static.py, twisted/tap/web.py: Added a new feature
	that allows requests for /foo to return /foo.extension, which is
	disabled by default. If you want a --static webserver that
	uses this feature, use 'mktap web --static <dir> --allow_ignore_ext'.

	* twisted/tap/web.py: Also switched --static to --path; it doesn't
	make sense to call something that automatically executes cgis, epys,
	rpys, php, etc., "static". :-)

2002-04-14  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* HTTP 1.1 now supports persistent and pipelined connections.

	User-visible API changes:
	- Request.content is now a file-like object, instead of a string.
	- Functions that incorrectly used Request.received instead of
	  Request.getAllHeaders() will break.
	- sendHeader, finishHeaders, sendStatus are all hidden now.

2002-04-12  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/coil/plugins/tendril.py (TendrilConfigurator): New coil
	configurator for words.tendril.

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.17.0

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/bugs: Gone. Separate plugin package.
	* twisted/eco: Gone. The king is dead. Long live the king!
	(eco is no longer going to be developed, Pyrex has obviated it.)

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/irc.py: Some fix-ups to IRCClient and
	DccFileReceive, from Joe Jordan (psy).

2002-04-10  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/reality: Gone. This is now in a completely separate plugin
	package.

2002-04-09  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* win32 process support seems to *finally* be working correctly. Many
	thanks to Drew Whitehouse for help with testing and debugging.

2002-04-08  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* coil refactored yet again, this time to use components and adapters.
	The design is now much cleaner.

2002-04-08  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/jelly.py: Refactored jelly to provide (a) more
	sane, language-portable API for efficient extensibility and (b)
	final version of "wire" protocol.  This should be very close to
	the last wire-protocol-breaking change to PB before
	standardization happens.

2002-04-04  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Removed __getattr__ backwards compatibility in PB

2002-04-03  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/usage.py, twisted/test/test_usage.py, bin/mktap, twisted/tap/*.py:
	Made the usage.Options interface better -- options are now stored in the
	'opts' dict. This is backwards compatible, and I added a deprecation warning.

2002-04-01  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.16.0.

2002-03-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added Qt event loop support, written by Sirtaj Singh Kang and
	Aleksandar Erkalovic.

2002-03-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added a 'coil' command for configuring TAP files

2002-03-15  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* XML-RPC published methods can now return Deferreds, and Twisted
	will Do The Right Thing.

2002-03-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Refactored coil, the configuration mechanism for Twisted.
	See twisted.coil and twisted.coil.plugins for examples of how
	to use the new interface. Chris Armstrong did some UI improvements
	for coil as well.

	* Checked in win32 Process support, and fixed win32 event loop.

2002-03-11  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@janus.twistedmatrix.com>

	* More robust shutdown sequence for default mainloop (other
	mainloops should follow suit, but they didn't implement shutdown
	callbacks properly before anyway...).  This allows for shutdown
	callbacks to continue using the main loop.

2002-03-09  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Automatic log rotation for twistd. In addition, sending SIGUSR1
	to twistd will rotate the log.

2002-03-06  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/widgets.py: Deprecated usage of Gadget.addFile(path)
	and replaced it with Gadget.putPath(path, pathname). This is
	a lot more flexible.

2002-03-05  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/win32.py: New win32 event loop, written by
	Andrew Bennetts.

	* twisted/tap/*: Changed the interface for creating tap modules - use
	a method called updateApplication instead of getPorts. this
	is a much more generic and useful mechanism.

	* twisted/internet/task.py: Fixed a bug where the schedular wasn't
	installed in some cases.

2002-03-04  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/server.py: authorizer.Unauthorized->util.Unauthorized
	(leftovers from removing .passport references.)

	* twisted/names/dns.py: Added support for TTL.

2002-03-02  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.15.4.

2002-03-02  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py: Send End-Of-MOTD message --
	some clients rely on this for automatic joining of channels
	and whatnot.

2002-03-02  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/names/dns.py: Fixed bugs in DNS client

	* twisted/mail/*, twisted/plugins.tml: The Mail server is now
	COILable.

	* bin/twistd: security fix: use a secure umask (077, rather than 0)
	for twistd.pid.

2002-02-26  Allen Short  <washort@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco/eco.py, twisted/eco/sexpy.py: ECO now supports
	backquoting and macros.

2002-02-26  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/ftp.py, twisted/plugins.tml: Made the FTP
	server COILable!

2002-02-26  Benjamin Bruheim  <phed@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/distrib.py: Fixed a win32-compatibility bug.

2002-02-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/socks.py: Made SOCKSv4 coilable, and fixed a
	bug so it'd work with Mozilla.

2002-02-24  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* .: Releasing Twisted 0.15.2.

2002-02-24  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* setup.py: Added plugins.tml and instancemessenger.glade installs
	so mktap and t-im work in a 'setup.py install' install.

	* debian/rules: Install plugins.tml so mktap works in debian installs.

	* doc/man/mktap.1, twistd.1: Updated the man pages to be more accurate.

2002-02-24  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/mktap: Better error reporting when we don't find
	the plugins files.

	* bin/twistd: Print out the *real* usage description rather than
	barfing when we get bad command line arguments.

2002-02-24  Moshe Zadka  <moshez@twistedmatrix.com>

	* debian/rules: Install the instancemessenger.glade file, so IM
	will work in debian installs.

2002-02-24  Paul Swartz  <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/protocols/oscar.py, socks.py, toc.py: Fixed a security
	hole in TOC where clients could call any method on the server.

2002-02-23  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/tap/coil.py: There is now a tap-creator for COIL.

	* twisted/internet/stupidproxy.py: Now with COILability!

2002-02-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* bin/mktap: mktap now uses Plugins instead of searching through
	twisted.tap. Yay for unified configuration systems!


2002-02-22  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im, twisted/words: t-im can now do topic setting (words
	only), fixed the Group Metadata-setting interface in the service.

2002-02-22  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/manhole: COIL can now load Plugins.

2002-02-21  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.spread.pb: Changed remote method invocations to be
	called through .callRemote rather than implicitly by getattr, and
	added LocalAsRemote utility class for emulating remote behavior.

2002-02-21  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.ftp: Fixed a lot of serious bugs.

2002-02-20  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.protocols.telnet: the python shell now supports
	multi-line commands and can be configured using coil.

2002-02-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted.lumberjack: a log rotation and viewing service.
	Currently only log rotation is supported.

2002-02-12  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py (IRCChatter.irc_AWAY): Fix bug
	where you can never come back from being away (at least using
	epic4).  Closes: #%d

2002-02-11  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/web/widgets.py: Changed Gadget.page to Gadget.pageFactory
	for clarity (this is backwards-compatible).

2002-02-10  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/spread/jelly.py:
	* twisted/spread/banana.py:
	* twisted/spread/pb.py: fixed bugs found by pychecker, got rid
	of __ping__ method support, and added 'local_' methods to
	RemoteReference

	* twisted/persisted/styles.py: pychecker bug fixes

	:) And added functions (anonymous and global), and broke various
	interfaces

2002-02-09  Allen Short  <washort@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco/eco.py: Refactored evaluator into a class, improved
	python-function argument signatures, and added and/or/not functions.

2002-02-08  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/service.py, ircservice.py: Fixed annoying PING
	bug, and added /topic support.

2002-02-08  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/eco: Initial prototype of ECO, the Elegant C Overlay
	macro engine.

2002-02-02  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/ircsupport.py:  Added support for the IRC protocol
	to IM.

2002-02-02  Chris Armstrong <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/deferred.py: added Deferred.addErrback, so now
	it's easy to attach errbacks to deferreds when you don't care
	about plain results.

	* twisted/im/chat.py, twisted/im/pbsupport.py: added support for
	displaying topics.

2002-02-02  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* SOCKSv4 support: there is now a protocols.socks, which contains
	support for SOCKSv4, a TCP proxying protocol.  mktap also has
	support for the new protocol.

2002-02-02  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py (IRCChatter.receiveDirectMessage),
	(IRCChatter.receiveGroupMessage),
	(IRCChatter.irc_PRIVMSG): Added CTCP ACTION <-> emote translation

2002-02-01  Paul Swartz <z3p@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/tocsupport.py: Added support for most of the TOC
	protocol to IM.


2002-02-01  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im/*.py: added metadata/emote support to IM. "/me foo"
	now triggers a backwards-compatible emote.


2002-01-30  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/tcp.py: Fixed the bug where startFactory() would
	get called twice.

2002-01-30  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/im: a new client for twisted.words (and eventually
	much more) based on GTK+ and Glade. This is mainly glyph's
	code, but I organized it for him to check in.

	* twisted/words/service.py: metadata support for words messages
	(only {'style': 'emote'} is standardized as of yet)

2002-01-29  Itamar Shtull-Trauring <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Added hook to tcp.Port and ssl.Port for limiting acceptable
	  connections - approveConnection(socket, addr).

2002-01-27  Chris Armstrong  <carmstro@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/words/ircservice.py: You can now change the topic
	of a channel with '/msg channelName topic <topic>' - note that
	'channelName' does *not* include the '#'.

2002-01-23  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* Incompatible change to PB: all remote methods now return
	Deferreds.  This doesn't break code in as many places as possible,
	but the connection methods now work differently and have different
	signatures.

	* Incompatible change to Banana: Banana now really supports floats
	and long integers.  This involved removing some nasty hackery that
	was previously part of the protocol spec, so you'll need to
	upgrade.

	* Added a feature to Jelly: Jelly now supports unicode strings.

	* Improved Twisted.Forums considerably: still needs work, but it's
	growing into an example of what you can do with a Twisted.Web
	application.

	* Added Twisted.Web.Webpassport -- generic mechanism for web-based
	login to arbitrary services.  This in conjunction with some code
	in Forum that uses it.

	* Incompatible change in Enterprise: all query methods now return
	Deferreds, as well as take arguments in an order which makes it
	possible to pass arbitrary argument lists for using the database's
	formatting characters rather than python's.

2002-01-15  Glyph Lefkowitz  <glyph@zelda.twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/internet/passport.py: (and friends) Retrieval of
	perspectives is now asynchronous, hooray (this took way too long)!
	Perspectives may now be stored in external data sources.  Lurching
	slowly towards a stable API for the Passport system, along with
	Sean's recent commits of tools to manipulate it.

2002-01-14  Kevin Turner  <acapnotic@twistedmatrix.com>

	* twisted/python/explorer.py: reimplementated.  So it's better.
	And yes, I broke the API.

	* twisted/manhole/ui/spelunk_gnome.py: Less duplication of visages,
	and they're draggable now too.

2002-01-13  Itamar Shtull-Trauring  <itamarst@twistedmatrix.com>

	* Changed twisted.enterprise.adabi so operations can accept lists
	  of arguments. This allows us to use the database adaptor's native
	  SQL quoting ability instead of either doing it ourselves, or the
	  *current* way twisted does it (not doing it at all, AFAICT!).

	  cursor.execute("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%s, %d), "it's magic", 12)

	  Problem is that different adaptors may have different codes for
	  quoting.

	* First go at database for twisted.bugs. I hate RDBMS. I hate web.
