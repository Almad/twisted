"""
Usage: gnusto mapName pickleName sourceName

Takes the twisted.reality generated python source in a map ("mapName")
and generates a pickle ("pickleName") as well as a source representation
of it ("sourceName", which should be identical to the code in "mapName"
unless manual changes were made to the source).
