      <h2>Classes</h2>

      <h3>Gadget</h3>
	<p>A collection of widgets. like a "directory" of HTML files. you add
	  widgets to it with self.addWidget("name", WidgetInstance()). This 
	  widget will be rendered inside the Gadget-local Page. Also, if you
	  make a Gadget that is also a subclass of "Widget", then whenever the
	  "index"  (http://foo.com/foo/, "foo" being the Gadget/Widget 
	  resource) is requested, the object will be rendered as a Widget 
	  inside of the Gadget-local Page. The Gadget-local Page is the 'page'
	  attribute of the gadget. So in your __init__ method for your Gadget
	  subclass, do <code>self.page = SomeWidgetPageSubclass</code> (note that it is 
	  _not_ an instance, but the actual class object).
	</p>

	<h3>Widget</h3>
	  <p>
	    A Widget is simply something that is renderable, using the 
	    display() method. This method is expected to return a list of 
	    HTML strings. (it can also contain instances of defer.Deferred
	    -- but this is another story).
	  </p>
	  
	<h3>Presentation</h3>
	  <p>
	    This is a special Widget that you don't create a display()
	    method for. You override the special 'template' variable, which
	    is a string with interpolated python expressions. It should look
	    something like:
	    <code>
	    template = '''
	    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;%%%%title%%%%&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
	    &lt;body&gt;%%%%getContent(request)%%%%&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
	    '''
	    </code>
	      
	    As you can see, Python expressions are denoted with surrounding
	    sets of 4 %'s. Note also that expressions are evaluated in the
	    namespace of the instance object itself -- this means that you
	    do not have to prefix method calls and attribute names with 
	    'self.'
	  </p>

	<h3>WidgetPage</h3>
	  <p>
	    A WidgetPage is a special Presentation that allows you to pass a Widget
            object to it's constructor. The most common use of this class is for subclassing;
            you should have a subclass that defines a 'template' class-variable, and probably
            nothing else. WidgetPage stores the widget you pass to it in it's 'widget'
            attribute, so remember that whenever you're making a customized template 
            (see "Common Pitfalls: WidgetPage" below).
	  </p>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>

<h3>WidgetPage</h3>
<p>
If you have a subclass of widgets.WidgetPage, make sure your template accesses the
widget it's displaying with the 'widget' object. For example, if you want to
get the title from the current widget you're displaying:
</p>

<p>
<code>
template = '''&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;%%%%widget.title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/html&gt;''' 
</code>
</p>
<p>
instead of:
</p>
<p>
<code>
template = '''&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;%%%%title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/html&gt;''' 
</code>
</p>

<h3>Adding Widgets to a Gadget</h3>
<p>
I had some code like this in one of my Gadgets:<br>
<code>self.addWidget("Foo", widgets.TitleBox(MyWidget())).</code><br>
Later whenever trying to access this widget I got this traceback:

<pre>
Traceback evaluating code in twisted.words.webwords.Page:Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/twisted/web/widgets.py", line 86, in display
    x = eval(elem, namespace, namespace)
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 0, in ?
AttributeError: TitleBox instance has no attribute 'getContent'
</pre>
<p>
Now remember, widgets that you add to a gadget with addWidget are rendered with self.page
like so: self.page(theChildWidget). The problem is, theChildWidget in this case was actually
TitleBox! and of course, TitleBox doesn't follow our template's protocol of having a 'getContent'
method. So, the lesson is: do not wrap your real widgets with other widgets when adding to
a Gadget: do formatting either in a) the template or b) the widget's display() method.
</p>

<h3>Return values of display</h3>
<p>
If you ever get a traceback like this:
</p>
<pre>
web.Server Traceback

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/punck/cvs/Twisted/twisted/web/server.py", line 215, in process
    body = resrc.render(self)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/twisted/web/widgets.py", line 408, in render
    displayed = self.display(request)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/twisted/web/widgets.py", line 97, in display
    tm.extend(val)
AttributeError: TitleBox instance has no attribute '__len__'
</pre>
<p>
It's because you tried to put a widget in the list that display() returns! for now, just tack
on '.display(request)' to all the widgets you want to return. This will be fixed later on, that
is, you will be able to include Widget objects in the list that display() returns.
