<h1>The Twisted Web FAQ</h1>

<h2>Is the Twisted web server a toy?</h2>

<p>No. It is a production grade server. It is running continously on several
sites and has been proven quite stable. The server can take loads of up to 3000
users at a time and still keep churning several million requests a day, even on
low end hardware. It can serve static files or dynamically rendered pages.</p>

<h2>But can Twisted Web do PHP?</h2>

<p>Yes.  It works out-of-the-box, so long as you've got the standalone php
interpreter installed.
</p>

<h2>And can Twisted Web do virtual hosting?</h2>

<p>Can it ever!</p>

<p>You can decide to go with one big process for all of them, a front server
and a seperate server for each virtual host (for example, for permission
reasons), and you can even mix-and-match between Apache and Twisted (for
example, put Apache in the front and have Twisted handle some subset of the
virtual host).</p>

<h2>How do I use twisted.web to do complex things?</h2>
