    <h1>Twisted Plugins</h1>

    <h3>Rationale</h3>

    <p>
      In order to simplify distribution of servers which use Twisted, and to
      allow them to be used with each other, there is a convention for
      distributing a set of functionality.  This convention may grow over time
      (most likely to include more metadata), as it is currently extremely
      simple.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
      A plugin is simply a directory.  A plugin must be a valid Python package,
      that is, it must contain an <code>__init__.py</code>.  A plugin may
      contain subpackages, or non-package resource directories.
    </p>
    <p>
      A plugin should also contain a file named <code>config.tac</code>.  This
      file is a Twisted Application Configuration.  It must be a valid Python
      file.  It must bind a variable called 'application' to an instance of a
      twisted.internet.main.Application.  This is for use with the
      <code>-g</code> option to <code>twistd</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the user's perspective, a plugin named <code>MyPlugin</code> with a
      <code>config.tac</code> may be dropped in their
      <code>~/TwistedPlugins</code> or <code>Twisted-x.x.x/plugins</code>
      directory, and then run with <code>twistd -g MyPlugin</code>.  From a
      developer's perspective, code from that plugin may simply be used by
      calling <code>import MyPlugin</code>.  Plugins that do not include a
      <code>config.tac</code> for some reason should be referred to as
      "code-only" plugins or "non-runnable" plugins.
    </p>

    <h3>Conventions</h3>
    <p>
      The function <code>twisted.python.util.sibPath</code> can be used in
      <code>config.tac</code> or anywhere else a plugin needs to load a
      resource file.  Canonical usage is something like this:
    <blockquote><pre>
from twisted.python.util import sibPath
myResourceData = open(sibPath(__file__,"myres.rsrc")).read()
      </pre></blockquote>
    which will load the file 'myres.rsrc' in the same directory as the referring file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugins are distributed as archives using the .zip, .tar.gz, or .tar.bz2 file format.
