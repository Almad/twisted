<ul>
  <li>Open up your project files. sometimes emacs can't find them if you
   don't have them open before-hand.</li>

  <li> M-x pdb, Run pdb as: twistd -b -f my.tap</li>

  <li>while pdb waits for your input, go to a place in your code and hit
   C-x SPC to insert a break-point. pdb should say something happy.
   Do this in as many points as you wish.</li>

   <li>Go to your pdb buffer and hit `c'; this runs as normal until a
   break-point is found.</li>

   <li>once you get to a breakpoint, use "s" to step, "n" to run the
   current line without stepping through the functions it calls, "w"
   to print out the current stack, "u" and "d" to go up and down a
   level in the stack, "p foo" to print result of expression "foo".</li>

   <li>recommendations for effective debugging:
   <ul>
     <li>use `p self' a lot; just knowing the class where the current code
     is isn't enough most of the time.</li>
     <li>use `w' to get your bearings, it'll re-display the current-line/arrow</li>
     <li>after you use `w', use `u' and `d' and lots more `p self's on the
     different stack-levels.</li>
     <li>If you've got a big code-path that you need to grok, keep another
      buffer open and list the code-path there (frex, I had a
      nasty-evil Deferred recursion, and this helped me tons)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
