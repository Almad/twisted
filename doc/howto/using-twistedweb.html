<h1>Configuring and Using the Twisted.Web Server</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> To install the Twisted.Web server, you'll need to have
<a href="installing-twisted">installed Twisted</a>.</p>

<p> Twisted servers, like the web server, do not have configuration files.  Instead, you instantiate the server and store it into a 'Pickle' file, <code>web.tap</code>.  This file will then be loaded by the Twisted Daemon.   </p>

<pre class="shell">
% mktap web --path /path/to/web/content
</pre>

<p> If you just want to serve content from your own home directory, the following will do:  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% mktap web --path ~/public_html/
</pre>

<p> Some other configuration options are available as well:  </p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>--port</code>: Specify the port for the web 
       server to listen on.  This defaults to 8080.  </li>
  <li> <code>--logfile</code>: Specify the path to the
       log file. </li>
</ul>

<p> The full set of options that are available can be seen with:  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% mktap web --help
</pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p> Once you've created a tap file, you can use COIL, a browser based interface, to configure it. Run this command:  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% coil web.tap
</pre>

<p> And then point your browser to http://localhost:9080 to see the config interface.  If you're configuring this on a remote machine, then substitute the name of that machine for <code>localhost</code>.  </p>

<p> Once you've finished configuring the server, hit Ctrl-C in the terminal where you run coil in order to shutdown the web server and save your changes.  </p>

<p> You're now ready to start your Twisted.Web server!  </p>

<h2>Using Twisted.Web</h2>

<h3>Stopping and Starting the Server</h3>

<p> Once you've created your <code>web.tap</code> file and done any configuration, you can start the server:  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% twistd -f web.tap
</pre>

<p> You can stop the server at any time by going back to the directory you started it in and running the command: </p>

<pre class="shell">
% kill `cat twistd.pid`
</pre>

<h3>Serving Flat HTML</h3>

<p> Twisted.Web serves flat HTML files just as it does any other flat file.  </p>

<a name="ResourceScripts" />
<h3>Resource Scripts</h3>

<p> A Resource script is a Python file ending with the extension <code>.rpy</code>, which is required to create an instance of a (subclass of a) <code class="API">twisted.web.resource.Resource</code>. </p>

<p> Resource scripts have 2 special variables: </p>

<ul>
  <li> <code class="python"><span class="py-src-identifier">__file__</span></code>: The name of the .rpy file, including the full path.  This variable is automatically defined and present within the namespace.  </li>
  <li> <code class="python"><span class="py-src-identifier">resource</span></code>: The variable which must be defined by the script and set to the resource instance that will be used to render the page. </li>
</ul>

<p> A very simple Resource Script might look like:  </p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.web import resource
class MyGreatResource(resource.Resource):
    def render(self, request):
        return "&lt;html&gt;foo&lt;/html&gt;"

resource = MyGreatResource()
</pre>

<h3>DOM Templates</h3>

<p> The DOM Templates system is a system for handling templated content.  See <a href="domtemplate">its documentation</a> for more details.  </p>

<a name="SpreadableWebServers" />
<h3>Spreadable Web Servers</h3>

<p> One of the most interesting applications of Twisted.Web is the distributed webserver; multiple servers can all answer requests on the same port, using the <code class="API">twisted.spread</code> package for "spreadable" computing.  In two different directories, run the commands:  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% mktap web --user
% mktap web --personal [other options, if you desire]
</pre>

<p> Both of these create a <code>web.tap</code>; you need to run both at the same time.  Once you have, go to http://localhost:8080/your_username.twistd/ -- you will see the front page from the server you created with the <code>--personal</code> option.  What's happening here is that the request you've sent is being relayed from the central (User) server to your own (Personal) server, over a PB connection.  This technique can be highly useful for small "community" sites; using the code that makes this demo work, you can connect one HTTP port to multiple resources running with different permissions on the same machine, on different local machines, or even over the internet to a remote site.  </p>


<h3>Serving PHP/Perl/CGI</h3>

<p>Everything related to CGI is located in the
<code>twisted.web.twcgi</code>, and it's here you'll find the classes that you
need to subclass in order to support the language of your (or somebody elses)
taste. You'll also need to create your own kind of resource if you are using a
non-unix operatingsystem (such as Windows), or if the default resources has
wrong pathnames to the parsers.</p>

<p>The following snippet is a .rpy that serves perl-files. Look at <code>twisted.web.twcgi</code>
for more examples regarding twisted.web and CGI.</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.web import static, twcgi

class PerlScript(twcgi.FilteredScript):
    filter = '/usr/bin/perl' # Points to the perl parser

resource = static.File("/perlsite") # Points to the perl website
resource.processors = {".pl": PerlScript} # Files that end with .pl will be processed by PerlScript
resource.indexNames = ['index.pl']
</pre>

<h3>Using VHostMonster</h3>

<p>It is common to use one server (for example, Apache) on a site with multiple
names which then uses reverse proxy (in Apache, via mod_proxy) to different
internal web servers, possibly on different machines. However, naive 
configuration causes miscommunication: the internal server firmly believes it
is running on "internal-name:port", and will generate URLs to that effect,
which will be completely wrong when gotten to the client.</p>

<p>While Apache has the ProxyPassReverse directive, it is really a hack
and is nowhere near comprehensive enough. Instead, the recommended practice
in case the internal web server is Twisted.Web is to use VHostMonster.</p>

<p>From the Twisted side, using VHostMonster is easy: just drop a file named
(for example) <code>vhost.rpy</code> containing the following:</p>

<pre>
from twisted.web import vhost
resource = vhost.VHostMonsterResource()
</pre>

<p>Of course, an equivalent <code>.trp</code> can also be used. Make sure
the web server is configured with the correct processors for the 
<code>rpy</code> or <code>trp</code> extensions (the web server 
<code>mktap web --path</code> generates by default is so configured).</p>

<p>From the Apache side, instead of using the following ProxyPass directive:</p>

<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost ip-addr&gt;
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8538/
ServerName example.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>Use the following directive:</p>

<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost ip-addr&gt;
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8538/vhost.rpy/http/example.com:80/
ServerName example.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>Naturally, mutatis-mutandis if you use Twisted.Web itself to do the
reverse proxying (though in that case, consider if you're not better off
using Twisted's internal distributed web facilities), Squid reverse proxying
or any other tool.</p>
