    <h1>Getting to 1.0</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Twisted 1.0 is not going to be stable. What is going to be
    stable are specific APIs, namely twisted.internet. Other parts
    of Twisted are still too immature to be considered stable, and
    will be worked on in later versions.</p>

    <p>The goal of this release, then, is to have <code
    class="python">twisted.internet</code> in a state where it is a
    suitable replacement for asyncore/Medusa. That means it should
    be stable API-wise, have as many tests as we can possibly write
    for it, and be well documented.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <p>We will, as soon as the <code
    class="python">twisted.internet</code> APIs are stable, switch
    to version 0.99.0. At this point, our goal is to document,
    write tests and fix bugs in <code
    class="python">twisted.internet</code> - all changes must API
    compatible from this point onwards.</p>

    <p>Changes to other parts of Twisted are acceptable, as long as
    they follow are usual policies.</p>

    <p>1.0 will be released when we feel that the level of bugs is
    sufficiently low, and the amount of documentation and unit
    tests is sufficiently high.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for 0.99</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Clean up connectors.</li>

      <li>New UDP API. [Possibly this will be done post-1.0]</li>

      <li>Make necessary changes to Application - whatever changes
      glyph wanted to make with authorizers and services.</li>

      <li>Finalize Deferred APIs. [Done, I think - glyph?]</li>

      <li>Low-level socket APIs - people want to turn off Nagle's
      algorithm and set other settings on sockets that are
      currently not supported. we need to formalize a method for
      this. [Can be done post-1.0, Nagle will be checked in right after 0.19.0]</li>

      <li>Support binding client sockets to specific
      interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I don't think we need to mark all modules for API stability
    level. I think we only need to mark modules that *are* stable,
    if they're not stable, "semi-stable" isn't useful, since we may
    yet think of some major changes that will make it less
    stable.</p>

    <p>So, another requirement is marking all modules whose API is
    stable as such, the rest of the modules can be left
    unmarked.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for 1.0</h2>

    <p>These are non-API-related changes that need to be made
    before 1.0 is released.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Move all bin/ scripts to twisted/scripts.</li>
    </ul>
