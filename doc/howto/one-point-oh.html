    <h1>Twisted 1.0 FAQ</h1>

    <h3>Does the 1.0 release mean that all of Twisted's APIs are stable?</h3>

    <p>No, only specific parts of Twisted are stable, i.e. we only promise
    backwards compatibility for some parts of Twisted. While these APIs may be
    extended, they will not change in ways that break existing code that uses
them. </p>

    <p>While other parts of Twisted are not stable, we will however do
    our best to make sure that there is backwards compatibility for these parts
    as well. In general, the more the module or package are used, and the closer they
    are to being feature complete, the more we will concentrate on providing backwards
    compatibility when API changes take place.</p>

    <h3>Which parts of Twisted 1.0 are stable?</h3>

    <p>Only modules explictily marked as such can be considered stable. Semi-stable
    modules may change, but not in a large way and some sort of backwards-compatibily
    will probably be provided. If no comment about API stability is present, assume
    the module is unstable.</p>

    <p>In Twisted 1.0, <b>most of twisted.internet is completely stable</b>, other than:
    
    <ol>
    <li>UDP support</li>
    <li>twisted.internet.win32eventreactor - will be replaced with win32support in future.</li>
    </ol>
    
    But as always, the only accurate way of knowing a module's stability is reading
    the module's docstrings.</p>

    <h3>Twisted really needs documentation for cred/PB/etc.</h3>

    Yes, we know. We are doing the best we can, and there is documentation
    in progress for many parts of Twisted. There is a limit to how much we
    can do in our free time. See also the answer to the next question.
    
    <h3>My company would love to use Twisted, but it's missing feature X</h3>

    <p>You have 3 options:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Pay one of the Twisted developers to implement the feature.</li>
    <li>Implement the feature yourself.</li>
    <li>Add a feature request to our bug tracker. We will try to implement the
        feature, but there are no guarantees when and if this will happen.</li>
    </ul>
