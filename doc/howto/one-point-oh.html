<h1>Getting to 1.0</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Twisted 1.0 is not going to be stable. What is going to be stable are
specific APIs, namely twisted.internet. Other parts of Twisted are still too
immature to be considered stable, and will be worked on in later versions.</p>

<p>The goal of this release, then, is to have 
<code class="python">twisted.internet</code> in a state where it is a suitable
replacement for asyncore/Medusa. That means it should be stable API-wise, have
as many tests as we can possibly write for it, and be well documented.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>We will, as soon as the <code class="python">twisted.internet</code> APIs
are stable, switch to version 0.99.0. At this point, our goal is to document,
write tests and fix bugs in <code class="python">twisted.internet</code> - all
changes must API compatible from this point onwards.</p>

<p>Changes to other parts of Twisted are acceptable, as long as they follow
are usual policies.</p>

<p>1.0 will be released when we feel that the level of bugs is sufficiently
low, and the amount of documentation and unit tests is sufficiently high.</p>

<h2>Requirements for 0.99</h2>

<ul>
<li>Clean up connectors.</li>
<li>New UDP API.</li>
<li>Make necessary changes to Application - whatever changes
    glyph wanted to make with authorizers and services.</li>
<li>Finalize Deferred APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think we need to mark all modules for API stability level. I think 
we only need to mark modules that *are* stable, if they're not stable, 
"semi-stable" isn't useful, since we may yet think of some major changes that 
will make it less stable.</p>

<p>So, another requirement is marking all modules whose API is stable as such,
the rest of the modules can be left unmarked.</p>
