<h1>Installing Twisted</h1>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> If you are on Windows, you may want to skip this and simply get the Windows Installer version of Twisted from the <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/products/download">download page</a>.  </p>

<p>If you are on Debian. you may want to use the Debian packages. The last
stable release of Twisted is at 
<q>deb http://twistedmatrix.com/users/moshez/apt ./</q>, and the last prerelease
of Twisted is at
<q>deb http://twistedmatrix.com/users/moshez/snapshot ./</q></p>

<p> To install Twisted, just make sure the
<code>Twisted-$VERSION/</code> directory is in the
<code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable. For example, if you
extracted Twisted-1.0.6rc2.tar.gz to /home/bob/, then you would have
something like: </p>

<pre class="shell">
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/bob/Twisted-1.0.6rc2/
</pre>

<p> in your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>,
<code>~/.cshrc</code>, etc. If you use Windows NT, 2000, or XP, then
set your environment variables by right-clicking on My Computer and
selecting Properties, then the Advanced tab, and click on the
<q>Environment Variables</q> button. If you use some other version of
windows, you'll need to set the variable at a command prompt, or in
autoexec.bat, with the 'set' command.  </p>

<p> If you'd like to install Twisted system-wide on your machine and
into the default <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, you can use
<code>setup.py</code> to do so: </p>

<pre class="shell">
# python ./setup.py install
</pre>

<p> Be sure to run <code>setup.py</code> with appropriate privileges (root under Unix).  </p>

<h2>Optional Compilation</h2>

<p>There are a couple of small optional alternative implementations of
pieces of Twisted that are in C for increased performance.  If you
don't run the installer, and you need these modules, you'll need to
perform a couple of extra steps: </p>

<pre class="shell">
$ python ./setup.py build_ext
</pre>

<p> This will (eventually) generate some shared libraries (cBanana.so,
cReactor.so) within a directory tree called 'build' under the Twisted
directory. </p>

<p> If you don't go on to install the build results into a directory
on the <code>$PYTHONPATH</code>, then you will need to create a couple
of symlinks: </p>

<pre class="shell">
$ cd twisted/spread
$ ln -s ../../build/lib.linux-i686-2.1/twisted/spread/cBanana.so cBanana.so
$ cd ../internet
$ ln -s ../../build/lib.linux-i686-2.1/twisted/internet/cReactor.so cReactor.so
</pre>

<p>The exact details of the symlinks may vary based on your system.  </p>

<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p> See our unit tests run, proving that the software is BugFree(TM):  </p>

<pre class="shell">
% admin/runtests
</pre>

<p>(From the directory where Twisted was originally untarred/unzipped to.)</p>

<p>Some of these tests will fail if you don't have the
Crypto packages installed on your system.</p>
