<h1>Manhole, The Twisted Interaction Client</h1>

<p> Manhole is a client that you can use to connect to the
twisted.manhole service.  It lets you execute arbitrary code on the
server, thus it is a great administration and debugging tool.  </p>

<h3>Starting the twisted.manhole service</h3>

<p> Execute the command 'mktap manhole -u [username] -w
[password]'. This will create a twisted application (.tap) file that
has a twisted.manhole service which will listen on port 8787. Execute
the command 'twistd -f manhole.tap' to actually start the server.
</p>

<h3>Using manhole</h3>
<p>
You can execute the command 'manhole' to start the GTK+ manhole client. This will
give you a window asking for your username, password, hostname, service, perspective,
and port #. Type in the username and password you selected above, the hostname that
the twisted.manhole service was started on (localhost is the default), leave the
Service the same ('twisted.manhole'), leave Perspective blank, and leave Port #
as the default of 8787. Click the "Log In" button and you will be greeted with a short
message in a window with an output area and an input area. You can type arbitrary
python code into the input area and get the results in the output area.
</p>

<h3>Special Commands</h3>
<p>
There are a few special commands so far that make debugging Twisted objects really
nice. These are /browse and /watch. You can /browse any type of object, and it will
give you some nice information about that object. /watch-ing an object adds hooks
to the object, allowing you to watch modifications to it in real time. For example:
</p>
<pre>
/browse ["hello", "there"]
<font color="blue">
  &lt;ObjectLink of ["hello", "there"] type list&gt;:
  ['hello',
   'there',]
</font>

class A:
    def foo(self):
        self.x = 1
x = A()
/browse x
<font color="blue">
&lt;ObjectLink of x type instance&gt;:
  {members: {}
   class: 'A'
   methods: {}}
</font>

/watch x
<font color="blue">
    &lt;ObjectLink of x type instance&gt;:
  {members: {}
   class: 'A'
   methods: {}}
</font>

x.foo()

<font color="blue">
&lt;ObjectLink of x type instance&gt;:
  {members: {x: 1}
   class: 'twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574'
   methods:
     {foo:
        &lt;ObjectLink of x.foo type instance_method&gt;:
          {class: 'twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574'
           self: '&lt;twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574 instance at 0x8195574&gt;'
           doc:
             Pretend to be the method I replaced, and ring the bell.
                     
           line: 651
           signature:
             [{name: instance},
              {name: a
               list: 1},
              {name: kw
               keywords: 1},]
           file: /home/punck/cvs/Twisted/twisted/python/explorer.py
           name: __call__}
        }}

&lt;ObjectLink of x type instance&gt;:
  {members: {x: 1}
   class: 'twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574'
   methods:
     {foo:
        &lt;ObjectLink of x.foo type instance_method&gt;:
          {class: 'twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574'
           self: '&lt;twisted.python.explorer.WatchingA8195574 instance at 0x8195574&gt;'
           doc:
             Pretend to be the method I replaced, and ring the bell.
                     
           line: 651
           signature:
             [{name: instance},
              {name: a
               list: 1},
              {name: kw
               keywords: 1},]
           file: /home/punck/cvs/Twisted/twisted/python/explorer.py
           name: __call__}
        }}
</font>
    </pre>
<p>
As you can see, /watch really gives you a lot of power (and a lot of output, too --
hopefully we'll have a nice GUI display for this in the future). The /browse
and /watch functionality is brought to you by the twisted.python.explorer module,
which was written largely by Kevin Turner.
