<h1>Why and How to use Twisted.Cred</h1>

<h2>(These docs cover the old, deprecated way Cred works. Read the 
    <a href="newcred.html">new Cred</a> docs to learn about the new
    system..)</h2>

<p>(This document is a work in progress.  Later it will include some examples
but for now a brief explanation is better than nothing!)</p>

<p>Twisted unifies authentication and account management of multiple services
in the Twisted.Cred package.  Although this authentication model was originally
designed to integrate services in the <a href="pb.html">Perspective Broker</a>
remote method invocation protocol, it is useful in many kinds of servers, and
work is underway to move all systems that require log-in in Twisted to use
twisted.cred. </p>

<p>In order to use twisted.cred, your code has to be structured around a
subclass of <code>Service</code>.  A service is a particular unit of
functionality which has a way to request <code>Perspective</code> objects.  You
will probably have to subclass both of these.</p>

<p>In order to simplify integration of services that come from lots of
different places, Twisted.Cred presents user-account related information in two
different ways.  Application-independent user information, such as passwords,
public keys, and other things related to the existence and authentication of a
particular person should reside in an <code>Identity</code>.  Information
related to a particular service, such as e-mail messages, high scores, or to-do
lists should be represented by a <code>Perspective</code>.</p>

<p>In support of these two basic abstractions is the <code>Authorizer</code>.
An authorizer serves primarily as the storage mechanism for a collection of
identities.  Its usage varies depending on whether the services it is providing
authentication for can support multiple services on one port.
<code>Authorizer</code> is an abstract class, but you don't need to implement
your own; the simplest authorizer to get started with is
<code>DefaultAuthorizer</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, there are basically 2 ways that an authorizer can be used.
It is either the root of a PB object hierarchy, or simply the authorizer for
some number of non-PB services.</p>

<h3>Setting Up a Service</h3>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet.app import MultiService
# A service which collects other services.
from twisted.cred.authorizer import DefaultAuthorizer
# A simple in-memory Authorizer implementation.
from my.service import MyService, OtherService
# Two sample user-written services.

multiserv = MultiService("pb")
# multiservice named "pb" to hold other services
auth = DefaultAuthorizer()
auth.setApplication(multiserv)
# the authorizer for both of our other services
myserv = MyService("my service", multiserv, auth)
otherserv = OtherService("another service", multiserv, auth)
# create both of our services pointing to their authorizer

from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.spread import pb
reactor.listenTCP(pb.portno, pb.AuthRoot(auth))
# If the services are all pb.Service subclasses, we can connect them to a
# network like this.  It will look up services through the serviceCollection
# passed to the Authorizer; which in this case was a MultiService but could
# also be an Application.
</pre>
