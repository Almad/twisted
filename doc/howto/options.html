    <title>Using usage.Options</title>

    <h1>Using usage.Options</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>There is frequently a need for programs to parse a UNIX-like
    command line program: options preceded by <code>-</code> or
    <code>--</code>, sometimes followed by a parameter, followed by
    a list of arguments. The <code
    class="API">twisted.python.usage</code> provides a class,
    <code>Options</code>, to facilitate such parsing.</p>

    <p>While Python has the <code>getopt</code> module for doing
    this, it provides a very low level of abstraction for options.
    Twisted has a higher level of abstraction, in the class <code
    class="API">twisted.python.usage.Options</code>. It uses
    Python's reflection facilities to provide an easy to use yet
    flexible interface to the command line. While most command line
    processors either force the application writer to write her own
    loops, or have arbitrary limitations on the command line (the
    most common one being not being able to have more then one
    instance of a specific option, thus rendering the idiom
    "<code>program -v -v -v</code>" impossible), Twisted allows the
    programmer to decide how much control she wants.</p>

    <p>The <code>Options</code> class is used by subclassing. Since
    a lot of time it will be used in the <code
    class="API">twisted.tap</code> package, where the local
    conventions require the specific options parsing class to also
    be called <code>Options</code>, it is usually imported with</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage
</pre>

    <h2>Boolean Options</h2>

    <p>For simple boolean options, define the attribute
    <code>optFlags</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="python">
class Options(usage.Options):

    optFlags = [["fast", "f"], ["safe", "s"]]
</pre>
    <code>optFlags</code> should be a list of 2-lists. The first
    element is the long name, and will be used on the command line
    as <code>--fast</code>. The second one is the short name, and
    will be used on the command line as <code>-f</code>. The long
    name also determines the name of the key that will be set in
    the 'opts' dict. Its value will be 1 if the option was seen, 0
    otherwise. Here is an example for usage: 
<pre class="python">
class Options(usage.Options):

    optFlags = [["fast", "f"], ["good", "g"], ["cheap", "c"]]

command_line = ["-g", "--fast"]

options = Options()
options.parseOptions(command_line)
if options.opts['fast']:
    print "fast",
if options.opts['good']:
    print "good",
if options.opts['cheap']:
    print "cheap",
print
</pre>

    <p>The above will print <code>fast good</code>.</p>

    <h3>Inheritance, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love
    the Superclass</h3>

    <p>Sometimes there is a need for several option processors with
    a unifying core. Perhaps you want all your commands to
    understand <code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code> means to be
    quiet, or something similar. On the face of it, this looks
    impossible: in Python, the subclass's <code>optFlags</code>
    would shadow the superclass's. However,
    <code>usage.Options</code> uses special reflection code to get
    all of the <code>optFlag</code>s defined in the hierarchy. So
    the following:</p>
<pre class="python">
class BaseOptions(usage.Options):

    optFlags = [["quiet", "q"]]

class SpecificOptions(BaseOptions):

    optFlags = [["fast", "f"], ["good", "g"], ["cheap", "c"]]
</pre>
    Is the same as: 
<pre class="python">
class SpecificOptions(BaseOptions):

    optFlags = [["quiet", "q"], ["fast", "f"], ["good", "g"], ["cheap", "c"]]
</pre>

    <h2>String Options</h2>

    <p>String options are specified using the attribute
    <code>optParameters</code>. They <em>must</em> be given a
    default. If you want to make sure you got the parameter from
    the command line, give a non-string default. Since the command
    line only has strings, this is completely reliable.</p>

    <p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage

class Options(usage.Options):

    optFlags = [["fast", "f"], ["good", "g"], ["cheap", "c"]]
    optParameters = [["user", "u", None]]

config.parseOptions() # When given no argument, parses sys.argv[1:]
if config.opts['user'] is not None:
    print "Hello," config.opts['user']
print "So, you want it:"

if config.opts['fast']:
    print "fast",
if config.opts['good']:
    print "good",
if config.opts['cheap']:
    print "cheap",
print
</pre>

    <p>Like <code>optFlags</code>, <code>optParameters</code> works
    smoothly with inheritance.</p>

    <h2>Generic Code For Options</h2>

    <p>Sometimes, just setting an attribute on the basis of the
    options is not flexible enough. In those cases, Twisted does
    not even attempt to provide abstractions such as "counts" or
    "lists", but rathers lets you call your own method, which will
    be called whenever the option is encountered.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of counting verbosity</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage

class Options(usage.Options):

    verbosity = 0 # default

    def opt_verbose(self):
        self.opts['verbosity'] = self.opts['verbosity']+1

    def opt_quiet(self):
        self.opts['verbosity'] = self.['verbosity']-1

    opt_v = opt_verbose
    opt_q = opt_quiet
</pre>

    <p>Command lines that like like "command -v -v -v -v" will
    increase verbosity to 4, while "command -q -q -q" will decrease
    verbosity to -3. Note that while it is not required, it is
    recommended that you store option-related state in the
    'self.opts' dict, which is where the rest of the options are
    stored.</p>

    <p>The <code>usage.Options</code> class knows that these are
    parameter-less options, since the methods do not receive an
    argument. Here is an example for a method with a parameter:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage

class Options(usage.Options):

    def __init__(self):
        usage.Options.__init__(self)
        self.opts['symbols'] = []

    def opt_define(self, symbol):
        self.opts['symbols'].append(symbol)

    opt_D = opt_define
</pre>

    <p>This example is useful for the common idiom of having
    <code>command -DFOO -DBAR</code> to define symbols.</p>

    <h2>Parsing Arguments</h2>

    <p><code>usage.Options</code> does not stop helping when the
    last parameter is gone. All the other arguments are sent into a
    function which should deal with them. Here is an example for a
    <code>cmp</code> like command.</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage

class Options(usage.Options):

    optParameters = [["max_differences", "d", 1]]

    def parseArgs(self, origin, changed):
        self.opts['origin'] = origin
        self.opts['changed'] = changed
</pre>

    <p>The command should look like <code>command origin
    changed</code>.</p>

    <p>If you want to have a variable number of left-over
    arguments, just use <code>def parseArgs(self, *args):</code>.
    This is useful for commands like the UNIX
    <code>cat(1)</code>.</p>

    <h2>Post Processing</h2>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to perform post processing of options to
    patch up inconsistencies, and the like. Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.python import usage

class Options(usage.Options):

    optFlags = [["fast", "f"], ["good", "g"], ["cheap", "c"]]

    def postOptions(self):
        if self.opts['fast'] and self.opts['good'] and self.opts['cheap']:
            raise usage.UsageError, "can't have it all, brother"
</pre>
