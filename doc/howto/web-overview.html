    <h1>Overview of Twisted Web</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
Twisted Web is a web application server written in pure Python, with APIs at
multiple levels of abstraction to facilitate different kinds of web
programming. The most useful for web application designers is <a
href="widgets.html">Web Widgets</a>, a high-level class-and-template oriented
system. There is also the Resource system, which Web Widgets is built on.
    </p>

    <h2>Twisted Web's Structure</h2>
    <p>
<table border=0>
<tr><td><img src="../img/web-overview.png" align="left" />
When the Web Server receives a request from a Client, it creates a Request
object and passes it on to the Resource system. The Resource system dispatches
to the appropriate Resource object based on what path was requested by the
client. The Resource is asked to render itself, and the result is returned to
the client.
</td></tr>
</table>
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
Resources are the lowest-level abstraction for applications in the Twisted web
server. Each Resource is a 1:1 mapping with a path that is requested: you can
think of a Resource as a single "page" to be rendered. The interface for making
Resources is very simple; they must have a method named <code>render</code>
which takes a single argument, which is the Request object (an instance of
<code class="API">twisted.web.server.Request</code>). This render method must return a
string, which will be returned to the web browser making the
request. Alternatively, they can return a special constant,
<code class="API">twisted.web.server.NOT_DONE_YET</code>, which tells the web server not to
close the connection; you must then use <code class="python">request.write(data)</code> to
render the page, and call <code class="python">request.finish()</code> whenever you're
done. There is more information about developing software with Resources in the
<a href="resources.html">Resources, CGIs, Static Content, and Linking</a>
document.
</p>


    <h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>
Web Widgets are an added layer of abstraction of Resources -- they're much
nicer for most sorts of web applications. For more information on Widgets, see
<a href="widgets.html">Introducing Web Widgets</a>.
