<h1>The Twisted FAQ</h1>

<h2>What is "Twisted"?</h2>

<p>Please see
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/products/twisted">Twisted</a>
</p>

<h2>Why should I use Twisted?</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/services/twisted-advantage">The
Twisted Advantage</a></p>

<h2>Why is Twisted so big?</h2>

<p>Twisted is a lot of things, rolled into one big package. We're not sure if 
it'll stay this way, yet, but for now, if you have only specific needs, we
recommend grabbing the big Twisted tarball, and if you want, you can run the
'setup.py' script with a modified config file to generate a package with only
certain Twisted sub-packages. Twisted as a whole makes it into many operating 
system distributions (FreeBSD, Debian and Gentoo, at least) so size shouldn't
be an issue for the end developer or user. In addition, packaging Twisted
as a whole makes sure the end users do not have to worry about versioning
parts of Twisted and inter-version compatibility.</p>

<p>If you are distributing Twisted to end-users, you can base your distribution
on the "Nodocs" packages, which are signficantly smaller.</p>

<h2>But won't Twisted bloat my program, since it's so big?</h2>

<p>No. You only need to import the sub-packages which you want to use, meaning
only those will be loaded into memory. So if you write a low-level network
protocol, you'd only import twisted.internet, leaving out extraneous things
like twisted.web, etc. Twisted itself is very careful with internal
dependancies, so importing one subpackage is not likely to import the whole
twisted package.</p>

<h2>Is Twisted stable enough for use in real programs?</h2>

<p>Large parts of Twisted have stable or semi-stable APIs - see the 
<a href="one-point-oh.html">Twisted 1.0</a> document.</p>

<h2>Is the Twisted web server a toy?</h2>

<p>No. It is a production grade server. It is running continously on several
sites and has been proven quite stable. The server can take loads of up to 3000
users at a time and still keep churning several million requests a day, even on
low end hardware. It can serve static files or dynamically rendered pages.</p>

<h2>Where can I find out how to write Twisted servers?</h2>

<p>Try <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/servers">Writing
Servers</a>.</p> 

<h2>Twisted is cool, but I need to add more functionality.</h2>

<p>Great! Read our the docs, and if you're feeling generous, contribute
patches.</p>

<h2>Help!</h2>

<p>Ask for help <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/services/online-help">where
the Twisted team hangs out</a></p>

<h2>I have this cool patch. To whom do I send it?</h2>

<p>To the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mailing list</a></p>

<h2>There's a bug in Twisted. Where do I report it?</h2>

<p>Unless it is a show-stopper bug, we usually won't fix it if it's already
fixed in <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/developers/cvs">CVS</a>, so you
would do well to look there. Then send any pertinent information about the
bug (hopefully as much information needed to reproduce it: OS, CVS versions
of any important files, Python version, code you wrote or things you did
to trigger the bug, etc.) to the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mailing list</a></p>

<h2>How do I use twisted.web to do complex things?</h2>

<p>See <a href="using-twistedweb.html">the Twisted.Web Howto</a>.</p>

<h2>I've been using Woven since before it was called Woven.  I just upgraded
and now I'm getting a confusing traceback talking about INodeMutator. What
gives?</h2>

<p>You probably have code that's survived the upgrade from PyXML's
<code>minidom</code> to Twisted's <code>microdom</code>.  Try deleting any
<code>.pxp</code> files that you have lying around and the error will probably
go away.</p>
