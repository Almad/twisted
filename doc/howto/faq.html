<h1>The Twisted FAQ</h1>

<h2>What is "Twisted"?</h2>

<p>Please see

<h2>Why should I use Twisted?</h2>

<p>See <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/services/twisted-advantage">The
Twisted Advantage</a></p>

<h2>3 Why is Twisted so big?</h2>

<p>Twisted is a lot of things, rolled into one big package. We're not sure if 
it'll stay this way, yet, but for now, if you have only specific needs, we
recommend grabbing the big Twisted tarball, and if you want, you can run the
'setup.py' script with a modified config file to generate a package with only
certain Twisted sub-packages. Twisted as a whole makes it into many operating 
system distributions (FreeBSD, Debian and Gentoo, at least) so size shouldn't
be an issue for the end developer or user. In addition, packaging Twisted
as a whole makes sure the end users do not have to worry about versioning
parts of Twisted and inter-version compatibility.</p>

<p>If you are distributing Twisted to end-users, you can base your distribution
on the "Nodocs" packages, which are signficantly smaller.</p>

<h2>4 But won't Twisted bloat my program, since it's so big?</h2>

<p>No. You only need to import the sub-packages which you want to use, meaning
only those will be loaded into memory. So if you write a low-level network
protocol, you'd only import twisted.internet, leaving out extraneous things
like twisted.web, etc. Twisted itself is very careful with internal
dependancies, so importing one subpackage is not likely to import the whole
twisted package.</p>

<h2>5 Is the Twisted web server a toy?</h2>

<p>No. It is a production grade server. It is running continously on several
sites and has been proven quite stable. The server can take loads of up to 3000
users at a time and still keep churning several million requests a day, even on
low end hardware. It can serve static files or dynamically rendered pages.</p>

<h2>Where can I find out how to write Twisted servers?</h2>

<p>Try <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/servers">Writing
Servers</a>. 

<h2>Twisted is cool, but I need to add more functionality.</h2>

<p>Great! Read our the docs, and if you're feeling generous, contribute
patches.</p>
