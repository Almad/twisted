    <h1>Unit Tests in Twisted</h1>

    <p>Each <em>unit test</em> tests one bit of functionality in the
    software.  Unit tests are entirely automated and complete quickly.
    Unit tests for the entire system are gathered into one test suite,
    and may all be run in a single batch.  The result of a unit test
    is simple: either it passes, or it doesn't.  All this means you
    can test the entire system at any time without inconvenience, and
    quickly see what passes and what fails.</p>

    <h2>Unit Tests in the Twisted Philosophy</h2>

    <p>The <span class="twisted">Twisted</span> development team
    adheres to the practice of <a href=
    "http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgramming" >Extreme
    Programming</a> (XP), and the usage of unit tests is a cornerstone
    XP practice.  Unit tests are a tool to give you increased
    confidence.  You changed an algorithm -- did you break something?
    Run the unit tests.  If a test fails, you know where to look,
    because each test covers only a small amount of code, and you know
    it has something to do with the changes you just made.  If all the
    tests pass, you're good to go, and you don't need to second-guess
    yourself or worry that you just accidently broke someone else's
    program.</p>

    <h2>What to Test, What Not to Test</h2>

    <blockquote><p>You don't have to write a test for every single
    method you write, only production methods that could possibly break.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>-- Kent Beck, <cite>Extreme Programming Explained</cite>, p. 58.</p>

    <p>''Note: I haven't yet fully figured this out myself.  Anyone
    else with more experience want to enlighten us? -- Kevin''</p>

    <h2>Running the Tests</h2>

    <h3>How</h3>

    <pre class="shell">
$ Twisted/admin/runtests
    </pre>
    
    <p>You'll find that having something like this in your emacs init
    files is quite handy:</p>

<pre class="elisp">
(defun runtests () (interactive)
  (compile "python /somepath/Twisted/admin/runtests"))

(global-set-key [(alt t)] 'runtests)
</pre>
    <h3>When</h3>

    <p>Always always <em>always</em> be sure <a href=
     "http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/expUnitTestsAt100.htm">all the
     tests pass</a> before committing any code.  If someone else
     checks out code at the start of a development session and finds
     failing tests, they will not be happy and may decide to <em>hunt
     you down</em>.</p>

    <p>Since this is a geographically dispersed team, the person who
    can help you get your code working probably isn't in the room with
    you.  You may want to share your work in progress over the
    network, but you want to leave the main CVS tree in good working
    order.  So <a href=
    "http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_5.html" >use a branch</a>,
    and merge your changes back in only after your problem is solved
    and all the unit tests pass again.</p>

    <h2>Adding a Test</h2>

    <p>Please don't add new modules to Twisted without adding tests
    for them too.  Otherwise we could change something which breaks
    your module and not find out until later, making it hard to know
    exactly what the change that broke it was, or until after a
    release, and nobody wants broken code in a release.</p>

    <p>Tests go in Twisted/twisted/test/, and are named test_foo.py,
    where "foo" is the name of the module or package being tested.
    Extensive documentation on using the PyUnit framework for writing
    unit tests can be found in the <a href= "#links" >links
    section</a> below.</p>

    <p>One deviation from the standard PyUnit documentation: To ensure
    that any variations in test results are due to variations in the
    code or environment and not the test process itself, Twisted ships
    with its own copy of the PyUnit testing framework.  That just
    means that when you import the unittest module, you will <code
    class= "python" >from pyunit import unittest</code> instead of the
    standard <code class="python">import unittest</code>.</p>

    <p>(Now that unittest has been in the Python standard library
    for several releases, I'm even less convinced of this argument
    than before, but doesn't add more than a second or two to download
    time, so I don't worry it too much.)</p>

    <p>As long as you have followed the module naming and placement
    conventions, <code class="shell">runtests</code> will be smart
    enough to pick up any new tests you write.</p>
