<h1>Twisted from Scratch, or The Evolution of Finger</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Twisted is a big system. People are often daunted when they approach it. It's
hard to know where to start looking.
</p>

<p>
This guide builds a full-fledged Twisted application from the ground up, using
most of the important bits of the framework. There is a lot of code, but don't
be afraid.
</p>

<p>
The application we are looking at is a <q>finger</q> service, along the 
lines of the familiar service traditionally provided by UNIX&trade; servers. 
We will extend this service slightly beyond the standard, in order to 
demonstrate some of Twisted's higher-level features.
