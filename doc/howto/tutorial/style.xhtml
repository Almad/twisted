<h1>The Evolution of Finger: cleaning up the finger code</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This is the third part of the Twisted tutorial <a
href="index.xhtml">Twisted from Scratch, or The Evolution of Finger</a>.</p>

<p>In this section of the tutorial, we'll clean up our code so that it is
closer to a readable and extendable style.</p>

<h2>Write Readable Code</h2>

<p>The last version of the application had a lot of hacks. We avoided
sub-classing, didn't support things like user listings over the web, 
and removed all blank lines -- all in the interest of code
which is shorter. Here we take a step back, subclass what is more
naturally a subclass, make things which should take multiple lines
take them, etc. This shows a much better style of developing Twisted
applications, though the hacks in the previous stages are sometimes
used in throw-away prototypes.</p>
