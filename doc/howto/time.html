<h2>Spreading tasks over time</h2>

<p>

Sometimes we want to schedule tasks to be run at intervals, e.g. a
long calculation that might block twisted if the whole thing were to
be run at once. We do this using objects that conform to the Delayed
interface (see <code>twisted.python.delay</code>).
</p>

<p>
A delayed must define two functions:
<ul>
  <li><code>timeout(self)</code> -- return maximum number of seconds until we should next run, or None if we have nothing to run.
  <li><code>runUntilCurrent(self)</code> -- this command will be run at the very latest, but possibly before, the number of seconds returned by <code>timeout</code> has passed.
</ul>

For example:
<pre>
class LongCalculation:
    """Runs at least 100 multipications a minute."""
    
    value = 1L
    
    def timeout(self):
        return 0.01
    
    def runUntilCurrent(self):
       self.value = self.value * 2L

# register the Delayed object with the Twisted event loop:
o = LongCalculation()
from twisted.internet import main
main.addDelayed(o)

</pre>

</p>

<h2>Running tasks at fixed intervals</h2>

<p>We sometimes want tasks to be run at intervals, but without them
being called before that interval has passed.  For example, we may
want to run some task once a minute, no more and no less. Specifying
60.0 as <code>timeout</code>'s result is no good, since it is very
likely the task will be called long before 60 seconds have passed.
This how we can do so:
   
   <pre>
from twisted.python import delay

def OnceAMinute:
    """Should be run once a minute."""
    print "a minute has passed"

# create a delayed object
d = delay.Delayed()

# set the number of seconds each tick is
d.ticktime = 10

# run OnceAMinute every 6 ticks, and since we set each tick to be 10 seconds,
# OnceAMinute will be called every 60 seconds
d.loop(OnceAMinute, 6)

# register the Delayed object with the Twisted event loop:
from twisted.internet import main
main.addDelayed(d)

</pre>
</p>

<h2>Scheduling a task to be run in the future</h2>

<p>Let's say you want to run a task X seconds in the future. The way to do that is:

<pre>
from twisted.internet import main

def f():
    print "this will run in 3.5 seconds"

main.addTimeout(f, 3.5)

</pre>
</p>
