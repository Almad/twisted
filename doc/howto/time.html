    <h2>Scheduling a task to be run in the future</h2>

    <p>Let's say you want to run a task X seconds in the future.
    The way to do that is defined in the reactor interface <code
    class="API">twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime</code>:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

def f(s):
    print "this will run in 3.5 seconds: %s" % s

reactor.callLater(3.5, f, "hello, world")
</pre>

    <p>If we want a task to run every X seconds repeatedly, we can
    just re-add it every time it's run:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

def runEverySecond():
    print "a second has passed"
    reactor.callLater(1, runEverySecond)

reactor.callLater(1, runEverySecond)
</pre>
     
  </body>
</html>
