    <p>The maintainers on each of these packages are not
    necessarily the people who will be responsible for writing most
    of their code, although I've certainly tried to do that in most
    cases :). I would like to start delegating responsibility for
    deciding when something is done to my various "lieutenants", as
    linus calls them, that are currently working on Twisted. If you
    don't think you're the right person to maintain a package, let
    me know.</p>

        banana's versioning is an additional feature that changes
