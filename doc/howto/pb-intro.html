<h1>Introduction to Perspective Broker</h1>
<h1>Using Perspective Broker</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Suppose you find yourself in control of both ends of the wire: you
have two programs that need to talk to each other, and you get to use any
protocol you want. If you can think of your problem in terms of objects that
need to make method calls on each other, then chances are good that you can
use twisted's Perspective Broker protocol rather than trying to shoehorn
your needs into something like HTTP, or implementing yet another RPC
mechanism<span class="footnote">Most of Twisted is like this.  Hell, most of
unix is like this: if <em>you</em> think it would be useful, someone else has
probably thought that way in the past, and acted on it, and you can take
advantage of the tool they created to solve the same problem you're facing
now.</span>.</p>

<p>The Perspective Broker system (abbreviated <q>PB</q>, spawning numerous
sandwich-related puns) is based upon a few central concepts:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>serialization</em>: taking fairly arbitrary objects and types,
  turning them into a chunk of bytes, sending them over a wire, then
  reconstituting them on the other end. By keeping careful track of object
  ids, the serialized objects can contain references to other objects and
  the remote copy will still be useful. </li>
  
  <li><em>remote method calls</em>: doing something to a local object and
  causing a method to get run on a distant one. The local object is called a
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteReference</code>, and you
  <q>do something</q> by running its <code>.callRemote</code> method.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>This document will contain several examples that will (hopefully) appear
redundant and verbose once you've figured out what's going on. To begin
with, much of the code will just be labelled <q>magic</q>: don't worry about how
these parts work yet. It will be explained more fully later.</p>

<h2>Class Roadmap</h2>

<p>To start with, here are the major classes involved in PB, with links to
the file where they are defined (all of which are under twisted/, of
course). Don't worry about understanding what they all do yet: it's easier
to figure them out through their interaction than explaining them one at a
time.</p>

<ul>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.internet.app">Application</code></em>
  : <code>internet/app.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Service</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code>, subclassed from
  <code class="API" base="twisted.cred.service">Service</code>
  in <code>cred/service.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.internet.app">MultiService</code></em>
  : <code>internet/app.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.internet.protocol">Factory</code></em>
  : <code>internet/protocol.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">BrokerFactory</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Broker</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">AuthRoot</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code></li>

</ul>

<p>Other classes that are involved at some point:</p>

<ul>

  <li> <em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteReference</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code> </li>

  <li> <em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Root</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code>, actually defined as
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.flavors">Root</code>
  in <code>spread/flavors.py</code> </li>

  <li> <em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Referenceable</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code>, actually defined as
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.flavors">Referenceable</code>
  in <code>spread/flavors.py</code> </li>

</ul>

<p>Classes that get involved when you start to care about authorization and
security:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.cred.authorizer">Authorizer</code></em>
  : <code>cred/authorizer.py</code></li>
  
  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.cred.identity">Identity</code></em>
  : <code>cred/identity.py</code></li>

  <li><em><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Perspective</code></em>
  : <code>spread/pb.py</code>, subclassed from
  <code class="API" base="twisted.cred.perspective">Perspective</code>
  in <code>cred/perspective.py</code></li>

</ul>

<h3>Subclassing</h3>

<p>Technically you can subclass anything you want, but
techically you could also write a whole new framework, which would just
waste a lot of time. Knowing which classes are useful to change (by making
subclasses) is one of the bits of knowledge you pick up after using Twisted
for a few weeks. Here are some hints to get started:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code class="API" base="twisted.internet.protocol">Protocol</code>:
  subclass this if you need to implement a new protocol on
  the wire, like HTTP or SMTP (except that almost all of the standard ones
  are already implemented). You might also subclass one of the standard
  implementations if you want to change its back-end behavior: make an SMTP
  server which actually stores the messages in files instead of mailing
  them, or a Finger server that returns random messages instead of current
  login status. </li>

  <li><code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Root</code>, 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Referenceable</code>: you'll
  subclass these to make remotely-referenceable objects using PB. You don't
  need to change any of the existing behavior, just inherit all of it and add
  the remotely-accessible methods that you want to export.</li>
  
  <li><code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Perspective</code>, 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread">pb.Service</code>: you'll probably
  end up subclassing these when you get into PB programming (with
  authorization). There are a few methods you'll change, especially with
  regards to creating new Perspectives.</li>

  <li><code class="API" base="twisted.cred.authorizer">Authorizer</code>:
  subclass this if you want to get users from /etc/passwd,
  or a database, or LDAP, or other list of usernames and passwords.</li>

</ul>

<p>XXX: add lists of useful-to-override methods here</p>

<h2>Things you can Call Remotely</h2>

<p>At this writing, there are three <q>flavors</q> of objects that can be
accessed remotely through 
<code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteReference</code> objects.
Each of these
flavors has a rule for how the <code class="python">callRemote</code> message
is transformed
into a local method call on the server.  In order to use one of these
<q>flavors</q>, subclass them and name your published methods with the
appropriate prefix.

<ul>
  <li><code class="API">twisted.spread.pb.Perspective</code>
  
  <p>This is the first class we dealt with.  Perspectives are slightly special
  because they are the root object that a given user can access from a
  service.
  A user should only receive a reference to their <em>own</em>
  Perspective. PB works hard to verify, as best it can, that any
  method that can be called on a perspective
  directly is being called on behalf of the user who is represented by that
  perspective.  (Services with unusual requirements for <q>on behalf of</q>,
  such as simulations with the ability to posess another player's avatar, are
  accomplished by providing indirected access to another user's Perspective.)

  </p>

  <p>Perspectives are not usually serialized as remote references, so do not
  return a perspective directly. </p>
  
  <p>Remotely accessible methods on Perspectives are named with the
  <code class="python">perspective_</code> prefix. </p>
  </li>
 
  <li><code class="API">twisted.spread.flavors.Referenceable</code>

  <p>Referenceable objects are the simplest kind of PB object.  You can call
  methods on them and return them from methods to provide access to other
  objects' methods.  </p>

  <p>However, when a method is called on a Referenceable, it's not possible to
  tell who called it.</p>
  
  <p>Remotely accessible methods on Referenceables are named with the
  <code class="python">remote_</code> prefix.</p>
  
  </li>

  <li><code class="API">twisted.spread.flavors.Viewable</code>

  <p>Viewable objects are remotely referenceable objects which have the
  additional requirement that it must be possible to tell who is calling them.
  The argument list to a Viewable's remote methods is modified in order to
  include the Perspective representing the calling user.</p>

  <p>Remotely accessible methods on Viewables are named with the
  <code class="python">view_</code> prefix.</p>

  </li>
  
</ul>

</p>

<h2>Things you can Copy Remotely</h2>

<p>In addition to returning objects that you can call remote methods on, you
can return structured copies of local objects.</p>

<p>There are 2 basic flavors that allow for copying objects remotely.  Again,
you can use these by subclassing them.  In order to specify what state you want
to have copied when these are serialized, you can either use the Python default
<code class="python">__getstate__</code> or specialized method calls for that
flavor.</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="API">twisted.spread.flavors.Copyable</code>
  
  <p>This is the simpler kind of object that can be copied.  Every time this
  object is returned from a method or passed as an argument, it is serialized
  and unserialized.</p>

  <p><code class="API" base="twisted.spread.flavors">Copyable</code> provides a
  method you can override,
  <code class="py-prototype">getStateToCopyFor(perspective)</code>, which
  allows you to decide what an object will look like for the user who is
  requesting it. The <code class="python">perspective</code> argument will be
  an instance of
  the <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Perspective</code> subclass
  for your service, the one which is
  either pasing an argument or returning a result an instance of your Copyable
  class. </p>
  
  <p>For security reasons, in order to allow a particular Copyable class to
  actually be copied, you must declare a <code class="python">RemoteCopy</code>
  handler for
  that Copyable subclass.  The easiest way to do this is to declare both in the
  same module, like so:

  <pre class="python">
from twisted.spread import flavors
class Foo(flavors.Copyable):
    pass
class RemoteFoo(flavors.RemoteCopy):
    pass
flavors.setCopierForClass(str(Foo), RemoteFoo)
  </pre>
  
  In this case, each time a Foo is copied between peers, a RemoteFoo will be
  instantiated and populated with the Foo's state.  If you do not do this, PB
  will complain that there have been security violations, and it may close the
  connection.
  </p>

  </li>
  
  <li><code class="API">twisted.spread.flavors.Cacheable</code>
  
  <p>Let me preface this with a warning: Cacheable may be hard to understand.
  The motivation for it may be unclear if you don't have some experience with
  real-world applications that use remote method calling of some kind.  Once
  you understand why you need it, what it does will likely seem simple and
  obvious, but if you get confused by this, forget about it and come back
  later.  It's possible to use PB without understanding Cacheable at all.
  </p>

  <p>Cacheable is a flavor which is designed to be copied only when necessary,
  and updated on the fly as changes are made to it.  When passed as an argument
  or a return value, if a Cacheable exists on the side of the connection it is
  being copied to, it will be referred to by ID and not copied.</p>

  <p>Cacheable is designed to minimize errors involved in replicating an object
  between multiple servers, especially those related to having stale
  information.  In order to do this, Cacheable automatically registers
  observers and queries state atomically, together.  You can override the
  method <code class="py-prototype">getStateToCacheAndObserveFor(self,
  perspective, observer)</code> in order to specify how your observers will be
  stored and updated.
  </p>

  <p>Similar to 
  <code class="python">getStateToCopyFor</code>,
  <code class="python">getStateToCacheAndObserveFor</code> passes a
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Perspective</code>
  instance from your service.  It also passes an 
  <code class="python">observer</code>, which is a remote reference to a
  <q>secret</q> fourth referenceable flavor:
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteCache</code>.</p>

  <p>A <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteCache</code> is simply
  the object that represents your
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Cacheable</code> on the other side
  of the connection.  It is registered using the same method as 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">RemoteCopy</code>, above.
  RemoteCache is different, however, in that it will be referenced by its peer.
  It acts as a Referenceable, where all methods prefixed with 
  <code class="python">observe_</code> will be callable remotely.  It is
  recommended that your object maintain a list (note: library support for this
  is forthcoming!) of observers, and update them using
  <code class="python">callRemote</code> when the Cacheable changes in a way
  that should be noticeable to its clients.  </p>

  <p>Finally, when all references to a 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Cacheable</code> from a given 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Perspective</code> are lost, 
  <code class="py-prototype">stoppedObserving(perspective, observer)</code>
  will be called on the 
  <code class="API" base="twisted.spread.pb">Cacheable</code>, with the same
  perspective/observer pair that <code>getStateToCacheAndObserveFor</code> was
  originally called with.  Any cleanup remote calls can be made there, as well
  as removing the observer object from any lists which it was previously in.
  Any further calls to this observer object will be invalid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
