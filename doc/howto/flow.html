<h1>Cooperative Data Flows (via generators)</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Handling more than one Request</h3>

<p>When creating services to handle simultaneous requests, processing state
must be managed.  A common approach, threading, applies the method used 
for single user operations:  keeping processing state within local variables 
and function arguments.  In this case, the operating environment handles 
variable allocation and cleanup.   Unfortunately, threading requires much
preemption and locking magic to keep each thread's execution independent,
yet allowing data to be shared between threads.  This magic can lead to 
subtle programming errors, and, in the case of Python, slowness as every
changes to a mutable object must be synchronized with the global 
interpreter lock.</p>

<p>An alternative is to use a event-driven approach, where each operation
is broken down into distinct steps, each step scheduled for operation in 
an delayed execution queue.  In this approach, an object is often used 
used to maintain state information between each step, allowing other 
operations to be performed.  Often each step is a member function, queued
within Twisted using <code>reactor.CallLater</code>.</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Request:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_one)
    def step_one(self):
        print self.name, ": Step One"
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_two)
    def step_two(self):
        print self.name, ": Step Two"
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_done)
    def step_done(self):
        # cleanup, and don't call reactor again.
        pass

Request("James")
Request("Wendy")

# start and shut down the event loop
reactor.callLater(1, reactor.stop) 
reactor.run()
</pre>

<p>In the output of this example, one can see that execution alternates
between steps for James and Wendy's request.  In effect, the requests
are done in a parallel, cooperative manner.   While this is a good start,
it isn't perfect as the event loop is stopped with a hard-coded timeout.
It would be better for each Request object to signal when it is completed 
so that the event loop can be shut down sooner.</p>

<h3>Deferred Callbacks</h3>

<p>In Twisted, communication between operations is often accomplished with 
<code>defer.Deferred</code>.  The Deferred object decouples an asyncronous 
operation by providing a temporary storage location for its result.  Instead 
of calling the operation and waiting for a return value, an operation 
schedules itself to be executed with <code>reactor.callLater</code>and then
returns a <code>defer.Deferred</code> object.   At this point, the caller 
can register a callback function to be executed when the operation has
completed.  In the example below, <code>defer.DeferredList</code> is used 
to merge the result of each request into a single notification, which is
used to stop the main event loop.
</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

class Request:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.d    = defer.Deferred()
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_one)
    def step_one(self):
        print self.name, ": Step One"
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_two)
    def step_two(self):
        print self.name, ": Step Two"
        reactor.callLater(0, self.step_done)
    def step_done(self):
        self.d.callback(None) # notify callback that we are done

james = Request("James")
wendy = Request("Wendy")

# start and shut down the event loop
d = defer.DeferredList([james.d, wendy.d])
d.addCallback(lambda _: reactor.stop())
reactor.run()
</pre>

<p>While this <code>Deferred</code> approach is very good, it can get
quickly complicated, especially if the request is not a simple linear
sequence of steps, or when results must flow between steps incrementally.
The flow module addresses these shortcomings using python generators.</p>

<h2>Iterators and generators</h2>

<p>An iterator is basically an object which produces a sequence of values.
Python's iterators are simply objects with an <code>__iter__()</code> 
member function which returns an object (usually itself) which has a
<code>next()</code> member function.   The <code>next()</code> method is
then invoked till it raises a <code>StopIteration</code> exception.</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.python.compat import iter, StopIteration

class Counter:
    def __init__(self, count):
        self.count = count
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    def next(self):
        ret = self.count
        self.count -= 1
        if ret: return ret
        raise StopIteration
        return ret

import sys
if sys.version_info &lt; (2,2):
    def list(it):
        ret = []
        it = iter(it)
        try:
            while 1:
                ret.append(it.next())
        except StopIteration: pass
        return ret

print list(Counter(3))

# prints: [3, 2, 1]
</pre>

<h3>State pattern</h3>

<p>Often times it is useful for an iterator to change state during its 
production of values.  This can be done nicely with the 'state' pattern.</p>

<pre class="python">
class States:
    def __iter__(self):
        self.next = self.state_one
        return self
    def state_one(self):
        self.next = self.state_two
        return "one"
    def state_two(self):
        self.next = self.state_stop
        return "two"
    def state_stop(self):
        raise StopIteration

print list(States())

# prints: ['one', 'two']
</pre>

<h3>Generators</h3>

<p>With Python 2.2, there is a wonderful syntax sugar for creating
iterators... generators.   When a generator is first executed, an iterator
is returned.  And from there on, each invocation of <code>next()</code>
gives the subsequent value produced by the <code>yield</code> statement.
With generators, the two iterators above become very easy to express.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators 

def Counter(count):
    while count > 0:
        yield count
        count -= 1

def States():
    yield "one"
    yield "two"

print list(Counter(3))
print list(States())

# prints:
#    [3, 2, 1]
#    ['one', 'two']

</pre>

<p>One technical difference between iterators and generators, is that raising 
an exception from a generator permanently halts the generator, while raising 
an exception from an iterator's <code>next()</code> method does not
invalidate the iterator, that is, one could call the <code>next()</code> 
method again and possibly get results.   From here on, we use the generator 
syntax for building iterators.</p>

<h3>Chaining Generators</h3>

<p>It is often useful to view an operation information as a flow between 
stages, where each stage may have several states or steps.  This can be
coded where the output of one generator is consumed by another.  In this
view, the last generator in the chain 'pulls' data from previous stages.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators 

def Counter(count):
    while count &gt; 0:
        yield count
        count -= 1

def Consumer():
    producer = Counter(3)
    for result in producer:
        if 2 != result:
            yield result

print list(Consumer())

# prints: [3, 1]
</pre>

<p>While this is a very clean syntax for creating a multi-stage operation,
it would block all other operations.   Therefore, some mechanism for pausing
the generator and resuming it later is required.</p>

<h2>Introducing Flow</h2>

<p>The flow module provides this ability to cooperate with other tasks.
This is accomplished by wrapping iterables in a flow stage object and 
following an alternating yield pattern.  That is, before each value pulled
from the stage, the operation must yield the wrapper object.  During this
yield bookkeeping is done to prepare the next value, or, if the next value
is not available, re-scheduling the operation to be executed later.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.flow import flow

def Counter(count):
    while count &gt; 0:
        yield count
        count -= 1

def Consumer():
    producer = flow.wrap(Counter(3))
    yield producer
    for result in producer:
        if 2 != result:
            yield result
        yield producer

print list(flow.Block(Consumer))

# prints: [3, 1]
</pre>


<h3>Equivalent Forms</h3>

<p>In the above code, <code>producer.next()</code> is called
implicitly, and thus the generator above is equivalent to...</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
def Consumer():
    producer = flow.wrap(Counter(3))
    while True:
        yield producer
        result = producer.next()
        if 2 != result:
            yield result
</pre>

<p>The <code>next()</code> method of the wrapper object does several
things.  First, it checks to see if there are results ready, if so it
returns the next one.  If not, it looks for a failure, raising it.
And finally, checking to see if the end of the input has been reached.
More concretely...
</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
def Consumer():
    producer = flow.wrap(Counter(3))
    while True:
        yield producer
        if producer.results:
            result = producer.results.pop(0)
            yield result
            continue
        if producer.failure:
            producer.stop = 1
            producer.failure.trap()
        if producer.stop:
            break
</pre>

<h3>Handling failures</h3>

<p>Another difference between plain old iterables and one wrapped with
the flow module is that exceptions caught are wrapped with a
<code>twisted.python.failure.Failure</code> object for later delivery.
There are two basic ways to recover from exceptions.  One way is to list
expected exceptions in the call to <code>flow.wrap</code>.  Alternatively, 
a try/except block can be used, catching <code>flow.Failure</code> objects.
</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.flow import flow

def Producer(throw):
    yield 1
    yield 2
    raise throw
    yield 3

def Consumer(producer):
    producer = flow.wrap(producer, IOError)
    yield producer
    try:
        for result in producer:
            if result is IOError:
                # handle trapped error
                yield "trapped"
            else:
                yield result
            yield producer
    except AssertionError, err:
        # handle assertion error
        yield str(err)

print list(flow.Block(Consumer(Producer(IOError("trap")))))
print list(flow.Block(Consumer(Producer(AssertionError("notrap")))))

# prints: [1, 2, 'trapped']
# prints: [1, 2, 'notrap']
</pre>

<h3>Cooperate</h3>

<p>This seems like quite the effort, wrapping each iterator and then 
having to alter the calling sequence.  Why?  The answer is that it
allows for a <code>flow.Cooperate</code> object to be returned.   When 
this happens, the entire call chain can be paused so that other flows
can use the call stack.   For flow.Block, the implementation of Cooperate
simply puts the call chain to sleep.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.flow import flow

def gen():
    yield 'immediate'
    yield flow.Cooperate(2)
    yield 'delayed'

for x in flow.Block(gen):
   print x

# prints:
#  immediate
#  delayed
</pre>

<h3>Merge and Zip</h3>

<p>Cooperate can be demonstrated with <code>flow.Merge</code> and 
<code>flow.Zip</code> components.  These two stages join two or more
generators into a single stream.  The Merge operation does this by
rotating between any of its input streams which are available.  The
Zip operation, on the other hand, waits for a result from each stream
before it produces a result.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.flow import flow

def Right():
    yield "one"
    yield "two"
    yield flow.Cooperate()
    yield "three"

def Left():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

print "Zip", list(flow.Block(flow.Zip(Right,Left)))
print "Merge", list(flow.Block(flow.Merge(Right,Left)))

# Zip [('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3)]
# Merge ['one', 1, 'two', 2, 3, 'three']
</pre>

<h2>Integrating with Twisted</h2>

<p>While <code>flow.Block</code> is useful for understanding how flow
works, it undermines the whole purpose by sleeping during Cooperate
and blocking other operations.   Following are numerous examples of how
to integrate flow with the Twisted framework in a non-blocking manner.</p>

<h3>Deferred Flow</h3>

<p>For starters, the long example of Wendy and James, with its numerous
calls to <code>reactor.callLater</code> to schedule each step of the 
operation can be rewritten using flow.Deferred.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
from twisted.flow import flow

def request(name):
    print name, ": Step One"
    yield flow.Cooperate()
    print name, ": Step Two"

james = flow.Deferred(request("James"))
wendy = flow.Deferred(request("Wendy"))

# start and shut down the event loop
d = defer.DeferredList([wendy, james])
d.addCallback(lambda _: reactor.stop())
reactor.run()
</pre>

<p>Under the sheets, when <code>flow.Deferred</code> encounters a
<code>flow.Cooperate</code> event, it reschedules itself to be resumed
at a later time, allowing other asyncronous operations to proceed. Once
again, <code>defer.DeferredList</code> is only used here to stop the
reactor after all operations are completed.</p>

<h3>Flow Resources</h3>

<p>By using <code>flow.Deferred</code> it is easy to make up a web
resource which is both long running, but also can serve more than
one customer at a time.   Run the example below, and with two
browsers, view the webpage.  Notice that both web pages are 
being created at the same time.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.flow import flow

def cooperative(count):
    """ simulate a cooperative resource, that not block """
    from random import random
    idx = 0
    while idx &lt; count:
        val = random()
        yield flow.Cooperate(val)
        yield str(val)[-5:]
        idx += 1

def flowRender(req):
    count = int(req.args.get("count",["30"])[0])
    req.write("&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;")
    req.write(" %s Random numbers: &lt;ol&gt;\n" % count)
    source = flow.wrap(cooperative(count))
    yield source
    for itm in source:
        req.write("&lt;li&gt;%s&lt;/li&gt;\n" % itm)
        yield source
    req.write("&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n")

class FlowResource(resource.Resource):
    def __init__(self, gen):
        resource.Resource.__init__(self)
        self.gen = gen
    def isLeaf(self): return true
    def render(self, req):
        self.d = flow.Deferred(self.gen(req))
        self.d.addCallback(lambda _: req.finish())
        return server.NOT_DONE_YET

print "visit http://localhost:8081/ to view the example"
root = FlowResource(flowRender)
site = server.Site(root)
reactor.listenTCP(8081,site)
reactor.run()
</pre>

<h3>Flow Protocols</h3>

<p>The flow module can also be used to construct protocols easily, 
following is an echo client and server.   For each protocol, one
must yield the connection before reading from it.  When the generator 
finishes, the connection is automatically closed.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.flow import flow
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor
PORT = 8392

def echoServer(conn):
    yield conn
    for data in conn:
        conn.write(data)
        yield conn                                   
    reactor.callLater(0,reactor.stop)

server = protocol.ServerFactory()
server.protocol = flow.makeProtocol(echoServer)
reactor.listenTCP(PORT,server)

def echoClient(conn):
    conn.write("Hello World")
    yield conn
    print conn.next()
    conn.write("Another Line")
    yield conn
    print conn.next()

client = protocol.ClientFactory()
client.protocol = flow.makeProtocol(echoClient)
reactor.connectTCP("localhost", PORT, client)
reactor.run()
</pre>

<h2>Threading</h2>

<p>While the Flow module allows for multiple cooperative tasks
to work in a single thread, sometimes it is necessary to have
the output of another thread be consumed within a flow.  This
can be done with <code>twisted.flow.threads.Threaded</code>, which 
takes an iterable object and executes it in another thread.   
Following is a sample iterable, countSleep which simulates a blocking
producer which must be put into a thread.  To show that
<code>twisted.flow.threads.Threaded</code> does not block other operations,
a similar, cooperative count is included.
</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__ import generators
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
from twisted.flow import flow
from twisted.flow.threads import Threaded

def countSleep(index):
    from time import sleep
    for index in range(index):
        sleep(.3)
        print "sleep", index
        yield index

def countCooperate(index):
    for index in range(index):
        yield flow.Cooperate(.1)
        print "cooperate", index
        yield "coop %s" % index

d = flow.Deferred( flow.Merge(
        Threaded(countSleep(5)),
        countCooperate(5)))

# # alternatively
# d1 = flow.Deferred(Threaded(countSleep(5)))
# d2 = flow.Deferred(countCooperate(10))
# d = defer.DeferredList([d1,d2])

def prn(x):
    print x
    reactor.stop()
d.addCallback(prn)
reactor.run()
</pre>

<h3>Using database connections</h3>

<p>Since most standard database drivers are thread based, 
the flow builds on the <code>twisted.flow.threads.Threaded</code> by 
providing a <code>QueryIterator</code>, which takes an sql
query and a <code>ConnectionPool</code>.</p>

<pre class="python">
from __future__         import generators
from twisted.enterprise import adbapi
from twisted.internet   import reactor
from twisted.flow import flow
from twisted.flow.threads import QueryIterator, Threaded

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("SomeDriver",host='localhost', 
             db='Database',user='User',passwd='Password')

# # I test with...
# from pyPgSQL import PgSQL
# dbpool = PgSQL

sql = """
  (SELECT 'one')
UNION ALL
  (SELECT 'two')
UNION ALL
  (SELECT 'three')
"""
def consumer():
    print "executing"
    query = Threaded(QueryIterator(dbpool, sql))
    print "yielding"
    yield query
    print "done yeilding"
    for row in query:
        print "Processed result : ", row
        yield query

from twisted.internet import reactor
def finish(result): 
    print "Deferred Complete : ", result
    reactor.stop()
f = flow.Deferred(consumer())
f.addBoth(finish)
reactor.run()
</pre>
</body>
</html>
