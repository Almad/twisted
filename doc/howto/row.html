<h1>Twisted Enterprise Row Objects</h1>

<p>The Twisted Enterprise "row" module is a method of interfacing simple
python objects with rows in relational database tables. It has two
components: the Row class which developers sub-class for each
relational table that their code interacts with, and the DbReflector
which generates and contains the SQL to perform updates, inserts,
queries and deletes against the database.</p>

<p>The row module is intended for applications such as on-line games, and
web-site that require a back-end database interface.  It is not a full
functioned object-relational mapper for python - it deals best with
simple data types structured in ways that can be easily represented in
a relational database. It is well suited to building a python
interface to an existing relational database, and slightly less suited
to added database persistance to an existing python application.</p>


<h2>Class Definitions</h2>

<p>To interface to relational database tables, the developer must create
a class derived from the twisted.enterprise.row.RowObject class for
each table. These derived classes must define a class attribute
"rowColumns" which contains a list of the columns in the database
table that class corresponds to. The class should also define a class
attribute called "dbKeyColumns" which is a list of the primary key
columns of the table with a tuple of (columnName, columnType) for each
column. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
class RoomRow(row.RowObject):
    rowColumns = ["roomId","town_id","name","owner","posx","posy","width","height"]
    dbKeyColumns = [("id", "int4")]
</pre>

<p>The items in the rowColumns list will become data members of classes
of this type when they are created by the DbReflector.</p>

<h2>Initialization</h2>

<p>The initialization phase builds the SQL for the database
interactions. It uses the system catalogs of the database to do this,
but requires some basic information to get started. The "stubs" data
passed into the DBReflector is of the format:</p>

<pre class="python">
 [ (ClassObject, TableName, Primary Key Columns) ]
</pre>

<p>The "ClassObject" is a python class derived from the RowObject class -
eg. the RoomRow class defined above. The "TableName" is the name of a
table in the relational database. The "Primary Key Columns" is a list
of the primary keys of the table containing tuples of (columnName,
columnType) - note that this corresponds to the dbKeyColumns attribute
of the class defined above. The stubs list may contain data for more
than one database table. An example stubs list for the RoomRow class
we specified above:</p>

<pre class="python">
stubs = [ (RoomRow, "testrooms", RoomRow.dbKeyColumns) ]
</pre>

<p>Once the classes are defined and the stubs list ready, a DBReflector
can be instanciated. This requires a Twisted Enterprise ConnectionPool
object, and takes a callback method to be run when the initialization
is finished. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
def runTests(result):
    print "Done initializing"

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("pyPgSQL.PgSQL")
stubs = [ (RoomRow, "testrooms", [("roomId","int4")]) ]
reflector = row.DBReflector(dbpool, stubs, runTests)
</pre>

<h2>Creating Row Objects</h2>

<p>There are three methods of creating RowObjects - batch loading from
the database, single object selection from the database, and creating
a new instance ready to be inserted.</p>

<p>To load a set of rows from the database and create RowObject instances
for each of the rows, use the loadObjectsFrom method of the
DbReflector. This takes a tableName, primary key columns, a "user
data" parameter, an SQL "where clause". The where clause may be
omitted which will retrieve all the rows from the table. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
def gotRooms(rooms):
    for room in rooms:
        print "Got room:", room.id

refector.loadObjectsFrom("testrooms", RoomRow.dbKeyColumns, userData, RoomRow, "id > 5", ).addCallback(gotRooms)
</pre>

<p>For more advanced RowObject construction, loadObjectsFrom may also be
passed a factoryMethod that will be called for each of the rows with
the class object, the userData parameter, and a dictionary of data
from the database keyed by column name. This factory method should
return a fully populated RowObject instance and may be used to do
pre-processing, lookups, and data transformations before exposing the
data to user code. An example factory method:</p>

<pre class="python">
def testRoomFactory(roomClass, userData, kw):
    newRoom = roomClass(userData)
    newRoom.__dict__.update(kw)
    return newRoom
</pre>

<p>To load a single RowObject from the database, create an instance and
assign a key value to it, then use the "selectRow" method of the
DBReflector to populate it with data the database. This assumes that a
row exists in the corresponding database table with a key value that
matches the assigned primary key attributes of the row object
instance. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
    newRoom = RoomRow()
    newRoom.assignKeyAttr("roomId", 10)
    reflector.selectRow(newRoom).addCallback(onSelected)
</pre>

<p>Note that the "assignKeyAttr" method must be used to set primary key
attributes - regular attribute assignment of a primary key attribute
of a rowObject will raise an exception. This prevents the database
identity of RowObject from being changed by mistake.</p>

<p>The last method of creating a row object is for new instances that do
not already exist in the database table. In this case, create a new
instance and assign its primary key attributes and all of its member
data attributes, then pass it to the "insertRow" method of the
DBReflector. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
    newRoom = RoomRow()
    newRoom.assignKeyAttr("roomId", 11)
    newRoom.town_id = 20
    newRoom.name = 'newRoom1'
    newRoom.owner = 'fred'
    newRoom.posx = 100
    newRoom.posy = 100
    newRoom.width = 15
    newRoom.height = 20
    reflector.insertRow(newRoom).addCallback(onInsert)
</pre>

<p>This will insert a new row into the database table for this new RowObject instance.</p>


<h2>Updating Row Objects</h2>

<p>RowObjects have a "dirty" member attribute that is set to 1 when any
of the member attributes of the instance that map to database columns
are changed. This dirty flag can be used to tell when RowObjects need
to be updated back to the database. In addition, the "setDirty" method
can be overridden to provide more complex automated handling such as
dirty lists (be sure to call the base class setDirty though!). </p>

<p>When it is determined that a RowObject instance is dirty and need to
have its state updated into the database, pass that object to the
"updateRow" method of the DBReflector. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
    reflector.updateRow(room).addCallback(onUpdated)
</pre>

<p>For more complex behavior, the reflector can generate the SQL for the
update but not perform the update. This can be useful for batching up
multiple updates into single requests. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
    updateSQL = reflector.updateRowSQL(room)
</pre>

<h2>Deleting Row Objects</h2>

<p>To delete a row from a database pass the RowObject instance for that
row to the DBReflector "deleteRow" method. Deleting the python
Rowobject instance does <em>not</em> automatically delete the row from the
database. For example:</p>

<pre class="python">
    reflector.deleteRow(room)
</pre>
