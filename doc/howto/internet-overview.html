<h1>Overview of Twisted Internet</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Twisted Internet is a compatible collection of event-loops for Python.
It contains the code to dispatch events to interested observers, and a portable
API so that observers need not care about which event loop is running. Thus,
it is possible to use the same code for different loops, from Twisted's basic,
yet portable, <code>select</code>-based loop to the loops of various GUI
toolkits like GTK+ or Tk. Twisted Internet also contains a powerful persistence
API so that network programs can be shutdown and then resurrected with most
of the code unaware of this.</p>

<h2>Twisted Internet Interfaces</h2>

<p>Twisted Internet contains the various interfaces to the reactor
API, whose usage is documented in the low-level chapter. Those APIs
are <code>IReactorCore</code>, <code>IReactorTCP</code>,
<code>IReactorSSL</code>, <code>IReactorUNIX</code>, <code>IReactorUDP</code>,
<code>IReactorTime</code>, <code>IReactorProcess</code> and
<code>IReactorThreads</code>. The reactor APIs allow non-persistent calls
to be made.</p>

<p>Twisted Internet also covers the interfaces for the various transports,
in <code>ITransport</code> and friends. These interfaces allow Twisted
network code to be written without regard to the underlying implementation
of the transport.</code> 

<p>The <code>IProtocolFactory</code> dictates how factories, which are usually
a large part of third party code , are written.</p>

<h2>Twisted Internet Application</h2>

<p>The <code>app.Application</code> class allows for a similar API to the
reactor, which is automatically persistent. Applications usually persist
and resurrect automatically, depending on the usage. See
<a href="application.html">the Application documentation</a> for more
information.</p>
