Temporary directory that is used by epyrun when rebuilding
specific modules (as opposed to all of twisted). We need
this so we won't overwrite the existing index.html (and friends)
because the index.html (and friends) we generate here won't be
correct (since we are not building all the modules). Don't blame
me. epydoc made me do it.
