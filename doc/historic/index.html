<h1>Historical Documents</h1>

<p>Here are documents which contain no pertinent information or documentation.
People from the Twisted team have published them, and they serve as interesting
land marks and thoughts. Please don't look here for documentation -- however,
if you are interested in the history of Twisted, or want to quote from these
documents, feel free. Remember, however -- the documents here may contain
wrong information -- they are not updated as Twisted is, to keep their
historical value intact.</p>
