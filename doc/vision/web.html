<h1>Web vision</h1>

<h2>twisted.protocols.http</h2>

<p>First of all, we need to prevent resource consumption from
being too large. Main example is uploaded files via web forms
which are stored in memory. This was fixed at some point in
CVS using cgi.FieldStorage, but it broke distrib, so this needs
to wait for the distrib fix (see below).</p>

<p>In addition, we need to support the full HTTP RFC, starting
from chunked requests.</p>

<h2>twisted.web</h2>

<h3>distrib</h3>

<p>Instead of getting preparsed request, the secondary servers
should receive the byte stream of the http request directly,
and parse it themselves. This will make distrib continue working
if the http.Request object changes internally, and will probably
be faster as well, since less copying is needed.</p>
