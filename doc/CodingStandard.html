    <h1>Twisted Python Coding Standard</h1>
    <h3>Whitespace</h3>
    <p>
      Indentation is 4 spaces per indent.  Tabs are not allowed.  It is
      preferred that every block appear on a new line, so that control
      structure indentation is always visible.
    </p>
    <h3>Modules</h3>
    <p>
      Modules must be named in all lower-case, preferably short, single words.
      If a module name contains multiple words, they may be separated by
      underscores or not separated at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, modules should contain more than one class, function, or
      method; if a module contains only one object, consider refactoring to
      include more related functionality in that module.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realize that different ways to import a module have different
      semantics, so this rule is flexible, but: it is preferred that modules be
      imported directly into the namespace of the referencing module, and
      references to functionality in that module be prefixed with the module
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, <code>from twisted import reality; reality.Thing()</code>,
      not <code> import twisted.reality; twisted.reality.Thing()</code> or
      <code> from twisted.reality import Thing; Thing()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, sibling imports within a package may be required when
      circular module imports exist. Only use them in that case, and make sure
      module names are not ambiguous with other modules.
    </p>
    <h3>Packages</h3>
    <p>
      Package names should follow the same conventions as module names.  All
      modules must be encapsulated in some package.  Nested packages may be
      used to further organize related modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      __init__.py must never contain anything other than a docstring and
      (optionally) an __all__ attribute.  Packages are not modules and should
      be treated differently.  This rule may be broken to preserve backwards
      compatibility if a module is made into a nested package as part of a
      refactoring.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Docstrings</h3>
    <p>
      Wherever possible, docstrings should be used to describe the purpose of
      methods, functions, classes, and modules.  In cases where it's desirable
      to avoid documenting thoroughly -- for example, and evolving interface --
      insert a placeholder docstring ("UNDOCUMENTED" is preferred), so that the
      auto-generated API documentation will not pick up an extraneous comment
      as the documentation for that module/class/function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Docstrings are <em>never</em> to be used to provide semantic information
      about an object; this rule may be violated if the code in question is to
      be used in a system where this is a requirement (such as Zope).
    </p>
    <p>
      Docstrings should be indented to the level of the code they are
      documenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Docstrings should be triple-quoted.
    </p>

    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
      Classes are to be named in mixed case, with the first letter capitalized;
      each word separated by having its first letter capitalized.  Acronyms
      should be capitalized in their entirety.  Class names should not include
      the name of the module they are a part of.  Examples:
    <ul>
      <li> twisted.reality.Thing
      <li> twisted.web.HTTPClient
      <li> twisted.web.Handler
      <li> twisted.gloop.Handler
      <li> twisted.parser.Pattern
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Methods should be in mixed case, with the first letter lower case, each
      word separated by having its first letter capitalized.  For example,
      "someMethodName", "method".
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, a class will dispatch to a specialized sort of method using
      its name; for example, twisted.reflect.Accessor.  In those cases, the
      type of method should be a prefix in all lower-case with a trailing
      underscore, so method names will have an underscore in them.  For
      example, "get_someAttribute".  Underscores in method names in twisted
      code are therefore expected to have some semantic associated with them.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Functions should be named similiarly to methods.
    </p>
