      <h1>Twisted Python Coding Standard</h1>
      <h3>Naming</h3>
      <p>
        Try to choose names which are both easy to remember and meaningful.
        Some silliness is OK at the module naming level (see twisted.spread...)
        but when choosing class names, be as precise as possible.  Write code
        with a dictionary and thesaurus open on the table next to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to avoid overloaded terms.  This rule is often broken, since it is
        incredibly difficult, as most normal words have already been taken by
        some other software.  More importantly, try to avoid meaningless words.
        In particular, words like "handler", "processor", "engine", "manager",
        and "component" don't really indicate what something does, only that it
        does <b>something</b>.
      </p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Unit tests are written using the PyUnit framework.  Many examples are
        in the twisted.test package, and all tests should be integrated through
        the main test suite builder in twisted.test.test_all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acceptance tests are all automated by the bin/accepttests script
        currently.  (TODO: real acceptance tests strategy!)
      </p>
      <h3>Whitespace</h3>
      <p>
        Indentation is 4 spaces per indent.  Tabs are not allowed.  It is
        preferred that every block appear on a new line, so that control
        structure indentation is always visible.
      </p>
      <h3>Modules</h3>
      <p>
        Modules must be named in all lower-case, preferably short, single
        words.  If a module name contains multiple words, they may be separated
        by underscores or not separated at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, modules should contain more than one class, function, or
        method; if a module contains only one object, consider refactoring to
        include more related functionality in that module.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realize that different ways to import a module have different
        semantics, so this rule is flexible, but: it is preferred that modules
        be imported directly into the namespace of the referencing module, and
        references to functionality in that module be prefixed with the module
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <code>from twisted import reality; reality.Thing()</code>,
        not <code> import twisted.reality; twisted.reality.Thing()</code> or
        <code> from twisted.reality import Thing; Thing()</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, sibling imports within a package may be required when
        circular module imports exist. Only use them in that case, and make
        sure module names are not ambiguous with other modules.
      </p>
      <h3>Packages</h3>
      <p>
        Package names should follow the same conventions as module names.  All
        modules must be encapsulated in some package.  Nested packages may be
        used to further organize related modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        __init__.py must never contain anything other than a docstring and
        (optionally) an __all__ attribute.  Packages are not modules and should
        be treated differently.  This rule may be broken to preserve backwards
        compatibility if a module is made into a nested package as part of a
        refactoring.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Docstrings</h3>
      <p>
        Wherever possible, docstrings should be used to describe the purpose of
        methods, functions, classes, and modules.  In cases where it's
        desirable to avoid documenting thoroughly -- for example, and evolving
        interface -- insert a placeholder docstring ("UNDOCUMENTED" is
        preferred), so that the auto-generated API documentation will not pick
        up an extraneous comment as the documentation for that
        module/class/function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docstrings are <em>never</em> to be used to provide semantic
        information about an object; this rule may be violated if the code in
        question is to be used in a system where this is a requirement (such as
        Zope).
      </p>
      <p>
        Docstrings should be indented to the level of the code they are
        documenting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docstrings should be triple-quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Docstrings should be written in StructuredText format; more
        documentation is available on the <a
        href="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net">HappyDoc website</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, to accommodate emacs users:
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Single quotes of the type of the docstring's triple-quote should be
            escaped.  This will prevent font-lock from accidentally fontifying
            large portions of the file as a string.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code examples in docstrings should be prefixed by the | character.
            This will prevent IM-Python from regarding sample code as real
            functions, methods, and classes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
        <pre>
def foo2bar(f):
    """I am a function to convert foos to bars.

    I should be used when you have a foo but you want a bar; note that this is a
    non-destructive operation.  If I can\'t convert the foo to a bar I will raise a
    FooException().

    For example::

      |  import wombat
      |  def sample(something):
      |      f = something.getFoo()
      |      f.doFooThing()
      |      b = wombat.foo2bar(f)
      |      b.doBarThing()
      |      return b

    """
    # Optionally, actual code can go here.
        </pre>
      </p>
      
      <h3>Classes</h3>
      <p>
        Classes are to be named in mixed case, with the first letter
        capitalized; each word separated by having its first letter
        capitalized.  Acronyms should be capitalized in their entirety.  Class
        names should not include the name of the module they are a part of.
        Examples:
        <ul>
          <li> twisted.reality.thing.Thing </li>
          <li> twisted.web.Handler </li>
          <li> twisted.spread.pb.ViewPoint </li>
          <li> twisted.parser.patterns.Pattern </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Methods should be in mixed case, with the first letter lower case, each
        word separated by having its first letter capitalized.  For example,
        "someMethodName", "method".
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, a class will dispatch to a specialized sort of method using
        its name; for example, twisted.reflect.Accessor.  In those cases, the
        type of method should be a prefix in all lower-case with a trailing
        underscore, so method names will have an underscore in them.  For
        example, "get_someAttribute".  Underscores in method names in twisted
        code are therefore expected to have some semantic associated with them.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Functions should be named similiarly to methods.
      </p>
      
      <h3>C Code</h3>
      <p>
        Wherever possible, C code should be optional, and the default python
        implementation should be maintained in tandem with it.  C code should
        be strict ANSI C, and <strong>must</strong> build using GCC as well as
        Visual Studio for Windows, and really shouldn't have any problems with
        other compilers either.  Don't do anything tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
        C code should only be used for efficiency, not for binding to external
        libraries.  If your particular code is not frequently run, write it in
        Python.  If you require the use of an external library, develop a
        separate, external bindings package and make your twisted code depend
        on it.
      </p>
      <h3>Recommendations</h3>
      <p>
        These things aren't necessarily standardizeable (in that code can't be
        easily checked for compliance) but are a good idea to keep in mind
        while working on Twisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going to work on a fragment of the Twisted codebase, please
        consider finding a way that you would *use* such a fragment in daily
        life.  I use the Twisted Web server on the main TML website, and aside
        from being good PR, this encourages you to actively maintain and
        improve your code, as the little everyday issues with using it become
        apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twisted is a <strong>big</strong> codebase!  If you're refactoring
        something, please make sure to recursively grep for the names of
        functions you're changing.  You may be surprised to learn where
        something is called.  Especially if you are moving or renaming a
        function, class, method, or module, make sure that it won't instantly
        break other code.
      </p>
