class Interface:
    """Base class for interfaces.

    Interfaces define and document an interface for a class. An interface
    class's name must begin with I, and all its methods should have no
    implementation code.

    Objects that implement an interface should have an attribute __implements__,
    that should be either an Interface subclass or a tuple, or tuple of tuples,
    of such Interface classes.

    A class whose instances implement an interface should list the interfaces
    its instances implement in a class-level __implements__.

    For example::

        | class IAdder(Interface):
        |     'Objects implementing this interface can add objects.'
        |
        |     def add(self, a, b):
        |         'Add two objects together and return the result.'
        |
