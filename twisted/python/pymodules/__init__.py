Twisted Python Pymodules: Modules copied from python standard library,
which are not in the minimum python version required for twisted.
There should be no code in here which is not (as closely as possible) verbatim
from Python stdlib.

These modules must be marked with which python version they are first available
in, so it is clear when the Twisted copy can be removed.
