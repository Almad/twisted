Requirements

  Python 2.2 or later.

  Zope Interfaces 3.0.1 (http://zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface) - if
  you have ZopeX3 (at least version 3.0.0c1) installed that should
  work too.

  On Windows pywin32 is recommended (this is built in to ActivePython,
  so no need to reinstall if you use it instead of standard Python)

      deb http://twisted.sourceforge.net/debian/ ./

    Sid and sarge both have Twisted as well, but not necessarily the latest
    version.

  * FreeBSD, Gentoo 
    Twisted is in their package repositories.

      http://undefined.org/python/pimp/
  
  * Win32 
    EXEs are available from http://twisted.sf.net, as well as tarballs
    for other platforms. 
  
  * Other
    As with other Python packages, the standard way of installing from source 
    is:

      python setup.py install
  
  * RPM (Redhat, Mandrake, SuSE, etc)
    For RPM based platforms there is a spec file in the admin/ folder in the
    tarball.
