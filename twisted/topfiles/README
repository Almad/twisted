Twisted SVN-Trunk

Quote of the Release:


For information on what's new in Twisted SVN-Trunk, see the ChangeLog
file that comes with the distribution.

What is this?
=============

  Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications which
  works on Python 2.2.X, 2.3.X, and 2.4.X.  The following are the
  (important) modules included with Twisted::

  - twisted.application
    A "Service" system that allows you to organize your application in
    hierarchies with well-defined startup and dependency semantics,
  - twisted.cred
    A general credentials and authentication system that facilitates
    pluggable authentication backends,
  - twisted.enterprise
    Asynchronous database access, compatible with any Python DBAPI2.0
    modules,
  - twisted.internet
    Low-level asynchronous networking APIs that allow you to define
    your own protocols that run over certain transports,
  - twisted.manhole
    A tool for remote debugging of your services which gives you a
    Python interactive interpreter,
  - twisted.protocols
    Basic protocol implementations and helpers for your own protocol
    implementations,
  - twisted.python
    A large set of utilities for Python tricks, reflection, text
    processing, and anything else,
  - twisted.spread
    A secure, fast remote object system,
  - twisted.trial
    A unit testing framework that integrates well with Twisted-based code.

  Twisted supports integration of the Tk, GTK+, GTK+ 2, Qt, Mac OS X,
  or wxPython event loop with its main event loop. The Win32 event
  loop is also supported.

  There are many official Twisted subprojects, including clients and
  servers for web, mail, DNS, and more. You can find out more about
  these projects at http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/


Installing
==========

  Instructions for installing this software are in INSTALL.

Unit Tests
==========


  See our unit tests run proving that the software is BugFree(TM)::

   % trial -R twisted

  Some of these tests may fail if you
   * don't have the dependancies required for a particular
     subsystem installed,
   * have a firewall blocking some ports (or things like
     Multicast, which Linux NAT has shown itself to do), or
   * run them as root.


Documentation and Support
=========================

  Examples on how to use Twisted APIs are located in doc/examples;
  this might ease the learning curve a little bit, since all these
  files are kept as short as possible.  The file doc/howto/index.xhtml
  contains an index of all the HOWTOs: this should be your starting
  point when looking for documentation.

  Help is available on the Twisted mailing list::

    http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python
  
  There is also a very lively IRC channel, #twisted, on
  irc.freenode.net.
