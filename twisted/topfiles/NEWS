2.1.0 (2005-11-06)
==================

Features
--------
 - threadedselectreactor, a reactor which potentially makes
   integration with foreign event loops much simpler.
 - major improvements to twisted.conch.insults, including many new widgets.
 - adbapi ConnectionPools now have 'runWithConnection' which is
   similar to runInteraction but gives you a connection object instead of
   a transaction. [975]
 - __file__ is now usable in tac files
 - twisted.cred.pamauth now contains a PAM checker (moved from twisted.conch)
 - twisted.protocols.policies.LimitTotalConnectionsFactory now exists,
   which does as the name suggests
 - twisted.protocols.ident now uses /proc/net/tcp on Linux [233]
 - trial now recurses packages by default (a la the old -R parameter)
 - (PB) Calling a remote method that doesn't exist now raises
   NoSuchMethod instead of AttributeError.

Fixes
-----
 - FTP client and server improvements
 - Trial improvements: The code is now much simpler, and more stable.
 - twisted.protocols.basic.FileSender now works with empty files 
 - Twisted should now be much more usable on Pythons without thread support.
 - minor improvements to process code in win32eventreactor
 - twistd -y (--python) now implies -o (--nosave). [539]
 - improved lockfile handling especially with respect to unix sockets.
 - deferredGenerator now no longer overuses the stack, which sometimes
   caused stack overflows.
 - Failure.raiseException now at least always raises the correct Exception.
 - minor improvements to serialport code

Deprecations
------------
 - twisted.python.componts.getAdapter. Use IFoo(o) instead.
 - Adapter persistence (IFoo(x, persist=True)). Just don't use it.
 - log.debug. It was equivalent to log.msg(), just use that.
 - twisted.protocols.telnet. twisted.conch.telnet replaces it.
 - Setting a trial reporter using a flag to 'trial'. Instead of 'trial
   --bwverbose', for example, use 'trial --reporter=bwverbose'.
 - trial --coverage will become a flag in Twisted 2.2.
 - passing a fully-qualified python name to --reporter is
   deprecated. Pass only names of Reporter plugins.
 - trial --psyco.
 - trial -R (--recurse) is now the default, so passing it is deprecated.
 - trial --reporter-args. Use the plugin system to do this sort of thing.
 - trial.assertions.assertionMethod and trial.unittest.assertionMethod
   are both deprecated. Use instance methods on TestCases instead.
 - trial's deferredResult, deferredError, and wait functions. Return
   Deferreds from your test methods instead of using them.
 - Raising unittest.SkipTest with no arguments. Give a reason for your skip.
 - The Failure returned from a gatherResults and DeferredList is now
   of type FirstError instead of a tuple of (Exception, index). It
   supports a firstError[idx] syntax but that is deprecated. Use
   firstError.subFailure and firstError.index instead.
 - whenThreaded now simply calls the passed function synchronously.
