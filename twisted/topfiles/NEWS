2.5.0 (2006-12-29)
==================

Twisted 2.5.0 is a major feature release, with several interesting new
developments and a great number of bug fixes. Some of the highlights
follow.

 * AMP, the Asynchronous Messaging Protocol, was introduced.  AMP is
   a protocol which provides request/response semantics over a
   persistent connection in a very simple and extensible manner.

 * An Epoll-based reactor was added, which can be used with twistd or
   trial by passing "-r epoll" on the command line. This may improve
   performance of certain high-traffic network applications.

 * The 'twistd' command can now accept sub-commands which name an
   application to run. For example, 'twistd web --path .' will start a
   web server serving files out of the current directory. This
   functionality is meant to replace the old way of doing things with
   'mktap' and 'twistd -f'.

 * Python 2.5 is now supported. Previous releases of Twisted were
   broken by changes in the release of Python 2.5.

 * 'inlineCallbacks' was added, which allows taking advantage of the
   new 'yield' expression syntax in Python 2.5 to avoid writing
   callbacks for Deferreds.

In addition to these changes, there are many other minor features and
a large number of bug fixes.

 - reactor.iterate calls made inside of a Trial test case are
   deprecated (#2090)

   separate project. See http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/QTReactor
   (#2130, #2137)

   only meant to help in writing other reactors (#2126)

2.4.0 (2006-05-21)
==================

Features
--------
 - twisted.internet.task.Cooperator (Added along with #1701).

Fixes
-----
 - Errors in UDP protocols no longer unbind the UDP port (#1695).
 - Misc: #1717, #1705, #1563, #1719, #1721, #1722, #1728.


2.3.0 (2006-05-14)
==================

Features
--------
 - twisted-dev-mode's F9 now uses trial's --testmodule feature, rather than
   trying to guess what tests to run.  This will break files using the "-x"
   test-case-name hack (just use a comma separated list instead).
 - API Documentation improvements.
 - A new Producer/Consumer guide (#53)
 - Better-defined error behavior in IReactorMulticast (#1578)
 - IOCP Multicast support (#1500)
 - Improved STDIO support on Windows. (#1553)
 - LoopingCall supports Deferreds such that it will wait until a
   Deferred has fired before rescheduling the next call (#1487)
 - Added twisted.python.versions.Version, a structured representation
   of Version information, including support for SVN revision numbers
   (#1663)

Fixes
-----

 - Many trial fixes, as usual 
 - All API documentation is now correctly formatted as epytext (#1545)
 - twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.__repr__ is safer.
 - Fix trial's "until-failure" mode. (#1453)
 - deferredGenerator now no longer causes handled exceptions (or
   results) to propagate to the resulting Deferred (#1709).
 - Misc: #1483, #1495, #1503, #1532, #1539, #1559, #1509, #1538,
   #1571, #1331, #1561, #737, #1562, #1573, #1594, #1607, #1407, #1615,
   #1645, #1634, #1620, #1664, #1666, #1650, #1670, #1675, #1692, #1710,
   #1668.

Deprecations
------------

 - Removal of already-deprecated trial APIs: the assertions module,
   util.deferredResult, util.deferredError, util.fireWhenDoneFunc,
   util.spinUntil, util.spinWhile, util.extract_tb,
   util.format_exception, util.suppress_warnings, unittest.wait,
   util.wait
 - The backwards compatibility layer of twisted.python.components
   (e.g., backwardsCompatImplements, fixClassImplements, etc) has been
   disabled. The functions still exist, but do nothing as to not break
   user code outright (#1511)
 - Deprecate the usage of the 'default' argument as a keyword argument
   in Interface.__call__. Passing a second positional argument to
   specify the default return value of the adaptation is still
   supported.


2.2.0 (2006-02-12)
==================

Features
--------
 - Twisted no longer works with Python 2.2
 - FTP server supports more clients
 - Process support on Windows
 - twisted.internet.stdio improved (including Windows support!)
 - Trial:
   - Continued Trial refactoring
   - Default trial reporter is verbose black&white when color isn't supported
   - Deferreds returned in trial tests that don't fire before the
     unittest timeout now have their errback fired with a TimeoutError
   - raising SkipTest in setUp and setUpClass skips tests
   - Test suites are failed if there are import errors

Fixes
-----
 - iocpreactor fixes
 - Threadpool fixes
 - Fixed infinite loops in datagramReceived edge cases
 - Issues resolved: 654, 773, 998, 1005, 1008, 1116, 1123, 1198, 1221,
   1232, 1233, 1236, 1240, 1244, 1258, 1263, 1265, 1266, 1271, 1275,
   1293, 1294, 1298, 1308, 1316, 1317, 1321, 1341, 1344, 1353, 1359,
   1372, 1374, 1377, 1379, 1380, 1385, 1388, 1389, 1413, 1422, 1426,
   1434, 1435, 1448, 1449, 1456

Deprecations
------------
 - Trial:
   - spinWhile and spinUntil
   - util.wait
   - extract_tb and format_exception
   - util.suppressWarnings
   - runReactor is gone


2.1.0 (2005-11-06)
==================

Features
--------
 - threadedselectreactor, a reactor which potentially makes
   integration with foreign event loops much simpler.
 - major improvements to twisted.conch.insults, including many new widgets.
 - adbapi ConnectionPools now have 'runWithConnection' which is
   similar to runInteraction but gives you a connection object instead of
   a transaction. [975]
 - __file__ is now usable in tac files
 - twisted.cred.pamauth now contains a PAM checker (moved from twisted.conch)
 - twisted.protocols.policies.LimitTotalConnectionsFactory now exists,
   which does as the name suggests
 - twisted.protocols.ident now uses /proc/net/tcp on Linux [233]
 - trial now recurses packages by default (a la the old -R parameter)
 - (PB) Calling a remote method that doesn't exist now raises
   NoSuchMethod instead of AttributeError.

Fixes
-----
 - FTP client and server improvements
 - Trial improvements: The code is now much simpler, and more stable.
 - twisted.protocols.basic.FileSender now works with empty files 
 - Twisted should now be much more usable on Pythons without thread support.
 - minor improvements to process code in win32eventreactor
 - twistd -y (--python) now implies -o (--nosave). [539]
 - improved lockfile handling especially with respect to unix sockets.
 - deferredGenerator now no longer overuses the stack, which sometimes
   caused stack overflows.
 - Failure.raiseException now at least always raises the correct Exception.
 - minor improvements to serialport code

Deprecations
------------
 - twisted.python.componts.getAdapter. Use IFoo(o) instead.
 - Adapter persistence (IFoo(x, persist=True)). Just don't use it.
 - log.debug. It was equivalent to log.msg(), just use that.
 - twisted.protocols.telnet. twisted.conch.telnet replaces it.
 - Setting a trial reporter using a flag to 'trial'. Instead of 'trial
   --bwverbose', for example, use 'trial --reporter=bwverbose'.
 - trial --coverage will become a flag in Twisted 2.2.
 - passing a fully-qualified python name to --reporter is
   deprecated. Pass only names of Reporter plugins.
 - trial --psyco.
 - trial -R (--recurse) is now the default, so passing it is deprecated.
 - trial --reporter-args. Use the plugin system to do this sort of thing.
 - trial.assertions.assertionMethod and trial.unittest.assertionMethod
   are both deprecated. Use instance methods on TestCases instead.
 - trial's deferredResult, deferredError, and wait functions. Return
   Deferreds from your test methods instead of using them.
 - Raising unittest.SkipTest with no arguments. Give a reason for your skip.
 - The Failure returned from a gatherResults and DeferredList is now
   of type FirstError instead of a tuple of (Exception, index). It
   supports a firstError[idx] syntax but that is deprecated. Use
   firstError.subFailure and firstError.index instead.
 - whenThreaded now simply calls the passed function synchronously.
