0.5.0 (2007-01-06)
==================

Features
--------
 - (Jabber) IQ.send now optionally has a 'timeout' parameter which
   specifies a time at which to errback the Deferred with a
   TimeoutError (#2218)
 - (Jabber) SASL authentication, resource binding and session
   establishment were added. (#1046) The following were done in
   support of this change:
   - Rework ConnectAuthenticator to work with initializer objects that
     provide a stream initialization step.
   - Reimplement iq:auth as an initializer.
   - Reimplement TLS negotiation as an initializer.
   - Add XMPPAuthenticator as a XMPP 1.0 client authenticator (only), along
     with XMPPClientFactory.
   - Add support for working with pre-XMPP-1.0 error stanzas.
   - Remove hasFeature() from XmlStream as you can test (uri, name) in
     xs.features.
   - Add sendFooter() and sendStreamError() to XmlStream

Fixes
-----
 - (Jabber) Deferreds from queries which were never resolved before
   a lost connection are now errbacked (#2006)
 - (Jabber) servers which didn't send a 'realm' directive in
   authentication challenges no longer cause the Jabber client to
   choke (#2098)
 - (MSN) error responses are now properly turned into errbacks (#2019)
 - (IRC) A trivial bug in IRCClient which would cause whois(oper=True)
   to always raise an exception was fixed (#2089)
 - (IM) Bugs in the error handling and already-connecting cases of
   AbstractAccount.logOn were fixed (#2086)

Misc
----
