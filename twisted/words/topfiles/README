Twisted Words SVN-Trunk

Words was recently split out of Twisted.

Twisted Words depends on Twisted.

If you want MSN or the web interface to work, you need Twisted Web.

Xish was recently merged into Twisted Words.  Previously Jabber support
depended on the separate twisted.xish package, but now packages this as
twisted.words.xish.
