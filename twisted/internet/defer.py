    Why do we want this? Well, in cases where a function in a threaded
    program would block until it gets a result, for Twisted it should
    not block. Instead, it should return a Deferred.

    This can be implemented for protocols that run over the network by
    writing an asynchronous protocol for twisted.internet. For methods
    that come from outside packages that are not under our control, we use
    threads (see for example twisted.enterprise.adbapi).
