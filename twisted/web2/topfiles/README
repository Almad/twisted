Twisted.Web2
============

Twisted.Web2 is the next generation Web Server Framework built with 
Twisted.  Web2 is under active development and it's APIs should not be 
considered stable at this point.  It is not a version of Twisted.Web and
 with that in mind compatibility is not of the highest concern, though 
the compatibility layer does support many but not all twisted.web resources.

Improvements over Twisted.Web
-----------------------------

 * Streaming upload data
 * Support for multiple headers of the same name
 * Separation of low level HTTP and high level request handling which allows
it to run under other transports such as SCGI and CGI
 * IResource API improvements from Nevow
 * More versatile outgoing data streaming API
 * Correct header parsing
 * Full HTTP/1.1 support
 * Output filters (HTTP range support in a generic fashion, and gzip support)
 * Significantly better URI Rewriting when used behind a reverse proxy such as 
Apache's mod_pxy

Things to further improve
-------------------------

 * Speed, it's not very fast, depending on how the benchmarks are done it's 
either significantly faster than Twisted.Web or twice as slow.
 * Better twisted.web compatibility
 * More and better tests
