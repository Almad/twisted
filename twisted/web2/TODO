- Tests!!

- Figure out what HTTP requires w.r.t. TCP half closing.
   - Done: it requires closing write side before read side.
	- must add half-closing support to Twisted.
- Create default log observers for the log.msg's that we send.
- sendfile support
- Resource API for streaming data.
  - Also re-add form POST processing, and make it not suck.
- Resource API for prerender checking
- Add support for gzip Transfer-Encoding.
- Add parsers/generators for the rest of the headers.
  - Also think about whether the data format of the headers
	 is really what we want there.
- Handle HTTP methods properly on all standard resources, and make it easy 
	to do right on user resources
