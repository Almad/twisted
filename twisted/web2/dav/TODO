Clean up docstrings

Resource:
  self.allowedMethods in Resource should be a method, not an ivar.
  Does render() really make sense as distinct from render_GET?

File:
  Reconcile DAVFile's listNames() with File's
  contentTypes should be a (class) method, not an attribute.
    loadMimeTypes() may be superfluous

IResource:
  Add some methods (from DAVFile):
    etag()
    exists()
    lastModified()
    creationDate()
    contentLength()
    displayName()
    update()
  Add site to interface (it's in Resource)

ISite:
  Create ISite interface
  Add locateSiblingResource()? (I have it in DAVFile, which is an IResource)

IDAVResource:
  Create IDAVResource interface

Integrate authentication configuration into DAV methods.

Add attributes to http_* methods?
  per resource ALLOW?
    allowed()
  pre/post conditions per method (see deltaV)
    checkPreConditions()
    checkPostConditions() - perhaps more like an exception handler?

Figure out how to do logging without hacking renderHTTP()
