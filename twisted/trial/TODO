Trial conflates concepts
Want to move the xUnit architecture, because it's actually surprisingly powerful

"Executing a test should have no dependencies on the TestRunner, TestResult or
any containing TestSuites" ~ mpool


GOALS
- Command line to configure the runner and run

- Library that takes cmd line params and transforms to test suites

- test suites should be stock pyunit TestSuites unless good reason otherwise
  (case-by-case "good reason")

  - runner & result should be somewhat tightly joined

- TestResult should be re-introduced into Trial as a real concept

- trial environment should have a subclass of Suite that calls hooks on the
  result.  i.e. startModule etc, which are on Result

- Magic Twisted fu (e.g. reactor spinning) should be part of TestCase.run
  (a subclass of pyunit TestCase)

- Temporary directory set up should also be part of this.

- Command line can know about TestCase internals
