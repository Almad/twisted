Backwards Compatability Issues:

  PyOpenSSL does not work with Python 1.5.2, therefore there is no SSL support
  for this version of Python.

Troubleshooting:

  If you are going to use Python 2.0 or greater, you cannot regress an
  application pickle to a previous python version.  The pickle format is not
  backwards compatible, and this has accounted for at least two three-hour
  debugging sessions on the Twisted team.

  If you are using a Workstation version of Windows 2000, XP, or NT, you will
  not be able to listen on more than a fixed number of sockets at once, or open
  more than a small number of active connections.  Please do not report this as
  a bug in Twisted -- there is nothing we can do about it.  Feel free to report
  this as a bug to Microsoft.

  Due to issues with the way Python and Twisted handle running processes on
  Unix, the os.popen and related functions (e.g. the commands module) will
  not run correctly. A workaround, which will break twisted.internet.process,
  is to run:
  
      import signal
      signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, signal.SIG_DFL )

  This is fine as long as you are not using twisted.internet.process, which
  is currently used in Twisted itself only for CGI support.
