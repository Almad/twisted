Requirements

  Python 2.3 or later.

  Zope Interfaces 3.0.1 (http://zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface) - if
  you have ZopeX3 (at least version 3.0.0c1) installed that should
  work too.

  On Windows pywin32 is recommended (this is built in to ActivePython,
  so no need to reinstall if you use it instead of standard Python)
