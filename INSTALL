Installation

  Debian packages are available with these sources - for woody:

    deb http://twisted.sourceforge.net/debian/woody/ ./

  and for sarge/sid:

    deb http://twisted.sourceforge.net/debian/ ./

  Sid and sarge both have Twisted as well, but not necessarily the latest
  version.

  FreeBSD and Gentoo both have Twisted in their package repositories.

  Win32 EXEs are available from http://twisted.sf.net, as well as tarballs
  for other platforms. As with other Python packages, the standard way of
  installing from source is: 

    python setup.py install
  
  For RPM based platforms there is a spec file in the admin/ folder in the
  tarball.
