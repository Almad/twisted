This is the README for the Twisted Sumo package. For general
information about Twisted, see Twisted core README or our web site
at http://twistedmatrix.com/.

Twisted Sumo contains all of Twisted and its subprojects. A setup.py
is provided which will install Twisted and each subproject for
you. Run the command "python setup.py --help" for more information.
Twisted Sumo also includes Zope Interface, a dependency of Twisted and
most of its subprojects, in a directory named ZopeInterface-* in the
root directory.  Twisted requires at least Zope Interface 3.0.1 or
higher. It can also work with ZopeX3 version 3.0.0c1 or higher.
