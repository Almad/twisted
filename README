This is the README for the Twisted SVN repository; it is not included
in releases.

== **/topfiles ==

Project-specific READMEs (and other files, like setup.py, ChangeLogs 
and NEWS files) are located in **/topfiles/, where ** is twisted or 
any of its separated subprojects.

== bin/ ==
The executable scripts that come with Twisted core are in
bin/. Twisted subprojects get a subdirectory of bin/, like
bin/conch/conch.

== doc/ ==
Documentation resides in the doc/ directory, with a similar layout to
bin/.

== dist/ ==
The dist/ directory contains support for the package mechanism.

== twisted/ ==
twisted/, of course, contains the code. Each package that represents a
single project (e.g., the toplevel 'twisted', and 'twisted.web', etc,
but not 'twisted.python', since that's a part of core) probably has
zpkgtools support files in it.  These are as follows.

DEPENDENCIES.cfg 
  - a simple list of the dependencies of the package by resource-name.
PUBLICATION.cfg
  - Project meta-data
PACKAGE.cfg
  - Specifies what to include in this package.

See http://zope.org/Members/fdrake/zpkgtools/ for more information
about these files, specifically the section on metadata.

Notice that there is another .cfg file strewn about the repository:
EXTENSIONS.cfg. This is a Twisted-specific extension to zpkgtools that
facilates very flexible conditional compilation of extension
modules. See dist/twistedzpkg/README for details.


== info ==
zpkgtools is what we're using to create upstream packages now;
