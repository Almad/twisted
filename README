What is this?

  Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.  It includes a
  web server, a telnet server, a multiplayer RPG engine, a generic client and
  server for remote object access, and APIs for creating new protocols and
  services. Twisted supports integration of the Tk or GTK event loop with it's
  main event loop. It also has basic support for running servers on top of
  jython.

  Twisted currently supports the following protocols, all implemented in pure
  python, most of them as both servers and clients:
  
    - FTP
    - HTTP
    - SMTP
    - irc
    - telnet
    - POP3
    - AOL's instant messaging TOC
    - DNS (client only)
    - LDAP (client only)
    - finger
    - Echo, discard, chargen and friends
    - Perspective Broker

What's new in 0.12.0?

  A major refactor to Twisted's threading and logging infrastructure.
  
  Merged internet.threadtask into internet.task.
  
  Made a new threadtask - a threadpool subclass that integrates with
  twisted's event loop.
  
  Many fixes to words, twisted's IM client.

What can I do with it?

  First, put /where/you/untarred/Twisted-x.x.x/bin into your PATH, or
  equivalent variable for your OS.  If you plan to do Python development using
  Twisted, you probably want to put /where/you/untarred/Twisted-x.x.x into your
  PYTHONPATH environment variable as well.  Currently these scripts take a
  UNIX-centric view of the world, but to the best of my knowledge they function
  on win32 as well.

  Although there is lots of infrastructure support in Twisted, the immediately
  useful application for the end-user is Twisted Web.  Twisted Web is
  a webserver, written entirely in python, which is designed to be "zero
  maintenance".  We run the twistedmatrix.com website from it, and I can
  testify that it has met its goals at least for me! The server can comfortably
  handle 50 dynamic-content requests per second on fairly old hardware (I have
  a Pentium II/333); however, since Twisted is entirely in Python, it's quite
  easy to script the webserver to do whatever you like!

Unit Tests

  See our unit tests run in a lovely Tkinter GUI, proving that the software is
  BugFree(TM)::

   % runtests

  If you're feeling more brave, you can try the new "acceptance tests".  These
  require some setup and are mainly for the developers to decide if it's OK to
  release, but:

   % accepttests

Basic Servers

  There are various servers you can build and run in the main distribution,
  although they won't be covered here.  Twisted servers do not have
  configuration files; instead, you instantiate a server and put it into a
  Pickle file; your servers and all of their component objects are saved in
  that file, and can be loaded with the Twisted Daemon.

  The normal type of server to create is a webserver.  You can run this
  command::

    % mktap web --static static

  which will make a "static" webserver (one that reads from the filesystem) and
  run it from the provided 'static' directory.  This creates a file named
  'web.tap'.  By default, this server will run on port 8080, but you can change
  it with the --port option.

  You can also create a telnet server::

    % mktap telnet -p 8023 -u username -w password

  which will create a python-console telnet server listening on port 8023,
  which you can log into with the username "username" and the password
  "password".  This creates a file called 'telnet.tap'

  A generic chat server::

    % mktap words

  This creates a chat server application, with 2 different interfaces and a web
  administration port.  Web administration can be conducted on port 8080, the
  IRC server on 6667, and a PB service on port 8787.

  You'll need to create an account with the web tool before you can log in,
  even using IRC (a "bot" will ask you for your password upon connection).

  So far the IRC gateway has only been tested with mIRC, XChat, and ircII; I
  believe that these are relatively diverse clients, but YMMV.

  The "Instance Messenger" client is a GTK front-end to the twisted.words
  service which communicates with it using PB.  You can invoke it like this::

    % im

  A AOL Instant Messanger TOC Server is also available::

    % mktap toc -p 5190

  which creates the TOC server, running on port 5190.  To create a user, simply
  log in with the username and password you want.  If the name is not already
  taken on the server, it is created.  This creates a file called 'toc.tap'
  
Running Servers

  In order to run any of these servers, run this command::

    % twistd -f [application name].tap

  You can stop the server at any time by going back to the directory you
  started it in and running the command::

    % kill `cat twistd.pid`

"Spreadable" Webserver

  The web server can also host a telnet server as well as other services;
  mkwebserver --help can detail some of those options.  One of the most
  interesting applications, however, is the distributed webserver; multiple
  servers can all answer requests on the same port, using the twisted.spread
  package for "spreadable" computing.  In two different directories, run the
  commands::

    % mktap web --user
    % mktap web --personal [other options, if you desire]

  Both of these create a 'web.tap'; you need to run both at the same time.
  Once you have, go to http://localhost:8080/your_username.twistd/ -- you will
  see the front page from the server you created with the --personal option.
  What's happening here is that the request you've sent is being relayed from
  the central (User) server to your own (Personal) server, over a PB
  connection.  This technique can be highly useful for small "community" sites;
  using the code that makes this demo work, you can connect one HTTP port to
  multiple resources running with different permissions on the same machine, on
  different local machines, or even over the internet to a remote site.

Documentation and Support

  Although this is far from enough, some examples on how to use basic Twisted
  APIs are located in doc/examples; this might ease the learning curve a
  little bit, since all these files are kept as short as possible.

  As of this release, I realize that Twisted's documentation is rather sparse.
  I encourage you to read the source code and docstrings, but if you're curious
  as to what Twisted can do, please feel free to drop me an email at
  glyph@twistedmatrix.com, or to join #python on irc.openprojects.net for some
  live help.

  Part of the problem with documentation on a project like this is that
  everything seems obvious to me :-).  If you have trouble with a particular
  aspect of the Twisted system, I'd like to hear about what was confusing and
  why.  The process of your learning may be the material I build a tutorial
  from, so don't hesitate to ask!
