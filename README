This is the README for the Twisted Sumo package (as well as the SVN
repository). For general information about Twisted, see
topfiles/twisted/README or our web site at http://twistedmatrix.com/.

Twisted Sumo contains all of Twisted and its subprojects. A setup.py
is provided which will install Twisted and each subproject for
you. Run the command "python setup.py --help" for more information.

For information about the Twisted split that happened before 2.0, see
http://twistedmatrix.com/products/splitfaq

Below is an explanation of the layout of this tarball (as well as the
SVN repository).

== twisted/ == 
This directory contains the code. Each package that represents a
single project (e.g., the toplevel 'twisted', and 'twisted.web', etc,
but not 'twisted.python', since that's a part of core) has a
'topfiles' directory inside of it.

== bin/ ==
The executable scripts that come with Twisted core are in
bin/. Twisted subprojects get a subdirectory of bin/, like
bin/conch/conch.

== doc/ ==
Documentation resides in the doc/ directory, with a similar layout to
bin/.

== **/topfiles ==
Project-specific READMEs (and other files, like setup.py, ChangeLogs
and NEWS files) are located in **/topfiles/, where ** is twisted or
any of its separated subprojects.
