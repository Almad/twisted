This is the README for the Twisted SVN repository; it is not included
in releases.

== topfiles/ ==
Project-specific READMEs (and other files, like ChangeLogs and NEWS
files) are located in topfiles/*/, where * is either a twisted
subpackage name or 'core' for core Twisted.

== bin/ ==
The executable scripts that come with Twisted core are in
bin/. Twisted subprojects get a subdirectory of bin/, like
bin/conch/conch.

== doc/ ==
Documentation resides in the doc/ directory, with a similar layout to
bin/ and topfiles/.

== packages/ ==
The packages/ directory contains subdirectories for each special
Twisted package. Each subdirectory contains zpkgtools support files.

== twisted/ ==
twisted/, of course, contains the code. Each package that represents a
single project (e.g., the toplevel 'twisted', and 'twisted.web', etc,
but not 'twisted.python', since that's a part of core) probably has
zpkgtools support files in it.


== info ==
zpkgtools is what we're using to create upstream packages now;
Information on it can be found at
