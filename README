This is the README for the Twisted SVN repository; it is not included
in releases.

== **/topfiles ==

Project-specific READMEs (and other files, like setup.py, ChangeLogs 
and NEWS files) are located in **/topfiles/, where ** is twisted or 
any of its separated subprojects.

== bin/ ==
The executable scripts that come with Twisted core are in
bin/. Twisted subprojects get a subdirectory of bin/, like
bin/conch/conch.

== doc/ ==
Documentation resides in the doc/ directory, with a similar layout to
bin/.

== twisted/ == 
twisted/, of course, contains the code. Each package
that represents a single project (e.g., the toplevel 'twisted', and
'twisted.web', etc, but not 'twisted.python', since that's a part of
core) has a 'topfiles' directory inside of it.
