This is the README for the Twisted Sumo package (as well as the SVN
repository). For general information about Twisted, see
topfiles/twisted/README or our web site at http://twistedmatrix.com/.

Twisted Sumo contains all of Twisted and its subprojects. A setup.py
is provided which will install Twisted and each subproject for
you. Run the command "python setup.py --help" for more information.
Twisted Sumo also includes Zope Interface, a dependency of Twisted and
most of its subprojects, in a file named ZopeInterface-*.tgz in the
root directory.  Twisted requires at Zope Interface 3.0.1 or
higher. It can also work with ZopeX3 version 3.0.0c1 or higher.

For information about the Twisted split that happened before 2.0, see

Below is an explanation of the layout of this tarball (as well as the
SVN repository).

== twisted/ == 
This directory contains the code. Each package that represents a
single project (e.g., the toplevel 'twisted', and 'twisted.web', etc,
but not 'twisted.python', since that's a part of core) has a
'topfiles' directory inside of it.

== bin/ ==
The executable scripts that come with Twisted core are in
bin/. Twisted subprojects get a subdirectory of bin/, like
bin/conch/conch.

== doc/ ==
Documentation resides in the doc/ directory, with a similar layout to
bin/.

== **/topfiles ==
Project-specific READMEs (and other files, like setup.py, ChangeLogs
and NEWS files) are located in **/topfiles/, where ** is twisted or
any of its separated subprojects.
