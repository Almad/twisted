    % mkwebserver [--static <dirname>]

        (w/o static it's a demo, w/ static it is a fast and simple
        server)
        (recommended <dirname> is "static", to serve the included static html)

        % twistd -f web.spl

        % mozilla http://localhost:8080/

    % mktelnetserver 8023 admin password

        % twistd -f telnet.spl

        % telnet localhost 8023

(If you want to stop a server started during this process, just
    % kill `cat twistd.pid`)

addition to making sure your bar is green on the unit tests.)
