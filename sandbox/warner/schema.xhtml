<h1>NewPB Schemas</h1>

<em>NOTE! This is all preliminary and is more an exercise in semiconscious
protocol design than anything else. Do not believe this document. This
sentence is lying. So there.</em>

"""

RemoteReference objects should all be tagged with interfaces that they
implement, which point to representations of the method schemas.  When a remote
method is called, PB should look up the appropriate method and serialize the
argument list accordingly.

We plan to eliminate positional arguments, so local RemoteReferences use their
schema to convert callRemote calls with positional arguments to all-keyword
arguments before serialization.

Conversion to the appropriate version interface should be handled at the
application level.  Eventually, with careful use of twisted.python.context, we
might be able to provide automated tools for helping application authors
automatically convert interface calls and isolate version-conversion code, but
that is probably pretty hard.

Common banana sequences:

A reference to a remote object.
   (On the sending side: Referenceable or ReferenceTo(aRemoteable)
    On the receiving side: RemoteReference)
('remote', reference-id, interface, version, interface, version, ...)


A call to a remote method:
('fastcall', request-id, reference-id, method-name, 'arg-name', arg1, 'arg-name', arg2)

A call to a remote method with extra spicy metadata:
('call', request-id, reference-id, interface, version, method-name, 'arg-name', arg1, 'arg-name', arg2)

Special hack: request-id of 0 means 'do not answer this call, do not acknowledge', etc.

Answer to a method call:
('answer', request-id, response)
('error', request-id, response)

Decrement a reference incremented by 'remote' command:
('decref', reference-id)
