non-independent things left to do on newpb. These require deeper magic or
can not otherwise be done casually. Many of these involve fundamental
protocol issues, and therefore need to be decided sooner rather than later.

* decide whether to accept positional args in non-constrained methods

This is really a backwards-source-compatibility issue. In newpb, the
preferred way of invoking callRemote() is with kwargs exclusively: glyph's
felt positional arguments are more fragile. If the client has a
RemoteInterface, then they can convert any positional arguments into keyword
arguments before sending the request.

The question is what to do when the client is not using a RemoteInterface.
Until recently, callRemote("bar") would try to find a matching RI. I changed
that to have callRemote("bar") never use an RI, and instead you would use
callRemote(RIFoo['bar']) to indicate that you want argument-checking.

That makes positional arguments problematic in more situations than they were
before. The decision to be made is if the OPEN(call) sequence should provide
a way to convey positional args to the server (probably with numeric "names"
in the (argname, argvalue) tuples). If we do this, the server (which always
has the RemoteInterface) can do the positional-to-keyword mapping. But
putting this in the protocol will oblige other implementations to handle them
too.

* change the method-call syntax to include an interfacename

Scope the method name to the interface. This implies (I think) one of two
things:

 callRemote() must take a RemoteInterface argument

 each RemoteReference handles just a single Interface

Probably the latter, maybe have the RR keep both default RI and a list of
all implemented ones, then adapting the RR to a new RI can be a simple copy
(and change of the default one) if the Referenceable knows about the RI.
Otherwise something on the local side will need to adapt one RI to another.
Need to handle reference-counting/DECREF properly for these shared RRs.

From glyph:

 callRemote(methname, **args) # searches RIs
 callRemoteInterface(remoteinterface, methname, **args) # single RI

 getRemoteURL(url, *interfaces)

 URL-RRefs should turn into the original Referenceable (in args/results)
  (map through the factory's table upon receipt)

 URL-RRefs will not survive round trips. leave reference exchange for later.
  (like def remote_foo(): return GlobalReference(self) )

 move method-invocation code into pb.Referenceable (or IReferenceable
 adapter). Continue using remote_ prefix for now, but make it a property of
 that code so it can change easily.
  <warner> ok, for today I'm just going to stick with remote_foo() as a
  low-budget decorator, so the current restrictions are 1: subclass
  pb.Referenceable, 2: implements() a RemoteInterface with method named "foo",
  3: implement a remote_foo method
  <warner> and #1 will probably go away within a week or two, to be replaced by
  #1a: subclass pb.Referenceable OR #1b: register an IReferenceable adapter

 try serializing with ISliceable first, then try IReferenceable. The
 IReferenceable adapter must implements() some RemoteInterfaces and gets
 serialized with a MyReferenceSlicer.

** use the methods of the RemoteInterface as the "method name"

 rr.callRemote(RIFoo.add, **args)

Nice and concise. However, #twisted doesn't like it, adding/using arbitrary
attributes of Interfaces is not clean (think about IFoo.implements colliding
with RIFoo.something).

 rr.callRemote(RIFoo['add'], **args)
 RIFoo(rr).callRemote('add', **args)
  adaptation, or narrowing?

<warner> glyph: I'm adding callRemote(RIFoo.bar, **args) to newpb right now
<radix> wow.
<warner> seemed like a simpler interface than callRemoteInterface("RIFoo",
"bar", **args)
<radix> warner: Does this mean that IPerspective can be parameterized now?
<glyph> warner: bad idea
<exarkun> warner: Zope hates you!
<glyph> warner: zope interfaces don't support that syntax
<slyphon> zi does support multi-adapter syntax
<slyphon> but i don't really know what that is
<exarkun> warner: callRemote(RIFoo.getDescriptionFor("bar"), *a, **k)
<warner> glyph: yeah, I fake it. In RemoteInterfaceClass, I remove those
attributes, call InterfaceClass, and then put them all back in
<glyph> warner: don't add 'em as attributes
<glyph> warner: just fix the result of __getitem__ to add a slot actually
refer back to the interface
<glyph> radix: the problem is that IFoo['bar'] doesn't point back to IFoo
<glyph> warner: even better, make them callable :-)
<exarkun> glyph: IFoo['bar'].interface == 'IFoo'
<glyph> RIFoo['bar']('hello')
<warner> glyph: I was thinking of doing that in a later version of
RemoteInterface
<glyph> exarkun: >>> type(IFoo['bar'].interface)
<glyph> <type 'str'>
<exarkun> right
<exarkun> 'IFoo'
<exarkun> Just look through all the defined interfaces for ones with matching
names
<glyph> exarkun: ... e.g. *NOT* __main__.IFoo
<glyph> exarkun: AAAA you die
<radix> hee hee
* warner struggles to keep up with his thoughts and those of people around him
* glyph realizes he has been given the power to whine
<warner> glyph: ok, so with RemoteInterface.__getitem__, you could still do
rr.callRemote(RIFoo.bar, **kw), right?
<warner> was your objection to the interface or to the implementation?
<itamar> I really don't think you should add attributes to the interface
<warner> ok
<warner> I need to stash a table of method schemas somewhere
<itamar> just make __getitem__ return better type of object
<itamar> and ideally if this is generic we can get it into upstream
<exarkun> Is there a reason Method.interface isn't a fully qualified name?
<itamar> not necessarily
<itamar> I have commit access to zope.interface
<itamar> if you have any features you want added, post to
interface-dev@zope.org mailing list
<itamar> and if Jim Fulton is ok with them I can add them for you
<warner> hmm
<warner> does using RIFoo.bar to designate a remote method seem reasonable?
<warner> I could always adapt it to something inside callRemote
<warner> something PB-specific, that is
<warner> but that adapter would have to be able to pull a few attributes off
the method (name, schema, reference to the enclosing RemoteInterface)
<warner> and we're really talking about __getattr__ here, not __getitem__,
right?
<exarkun> for x.y yes
<itamar> no, I don't think that's a good idea
<itamar> interfaces have all kinds od methods on them already, for
introspection purposes
<itamar> namespace clashes are the suck
<itamar> unless RIFoo isn't really an Interface
<itamar> hm
<itamar> how about if it were a wrapper around a regular Interface?
<warner> yeah, RemoteInterfaces are kind of a special case
<itamar> RIFoo(IFoo, publishedMethods=['doThis', 'doThat'])
<itamar> s/RIFoo/RIFoo = RemoteInterface(/
<exarkun> I'm confused. Why should you have to specify which methods are
published?
<itamar> SECURITY!
<itamar> not actually necessary though, no
<itamar> and may be overkill
<warner> the only reason I have it derive from Interface is so that we can do
neat adapter tricks in the future
<itamar> that's not contradictory
<itamar> RIFoo(x) would still be able to do magic
<itamar> you wouldn't be able to check if an object provides RIFoo, though
<itamar> which kinda sucks
<itamar> but in any case I am against RIFoo.bar
<warner> pity, it makes the callRemote syntax very clean
<radix> hm
<radix> So how come it's a RemoteInterface and not an Interface, anyway?
<radix> I mean, how come that needs to be done explicitly. Can't you just
write a serializer for Interface itself?

* warner goes to figure out where the RemoteInterface discussion went after he
  got distracted
<warner> maybe I should make RemoteInterface a totally separate class and just
implement a couple of Interface-like methods
<warner> cause rr.callRemote(IFoo.bar, a=1) just feels so clean
<Jerub> warner: why not IFoo(rr).bar(a=1) ?
<warner> hmm, also a possibility
<radix> well
<radix> IFoo(rr).callRemote('bar')
<radix> or RIFoo, or whatever
<Jerub> hold on, what does rr inherit from?
<warner> RemoteReference
<radix> it's a RemoteReference
<Jerub> then why not IFoo(rr) /
<warner> I'm keeping a strong distinction between local interfaces and remote
ones
<Jerub> ah, oka.y
<radix> warner: right, you can still do RIFoo
<warner> ILocal(a).meth(args) is an immediate function call
<Jerub> in that case, I prefer rr.callRemote(IFoo.bar, a=1)
<radix> .meth( is definitely bad, we need callRemote
<warner> rr.callRemote("meth", args) returns a deferred
<Jerub> radix: I don't like from foo import IFoo, RIFoo
<warner> you probably wouldn't have both an IFoo and an RIFoo
<radix> warner: well, look at it this way: IFoo(rr).callRemote('foo') still
makes it obvious that IFoo isn't local
<radix> warner: you could implement RemoteReferen.__conform__ to implement it
<warner> radix: I'm thinking of providing some kind of other class that would
allow .meth() to work (without the callRemote), but it wouldn't be the default
<radix> plus, IFoo(rr) is how you use interfaces normally, and callRemote is
how you make remote calls normally, so it seems that's the best way to do
interfaces + PB
<warner> hmm
<warner> in that case the object returned by IFoo(rr) is just rr with a tag
that sets the "default interface name"
<radix> right
<warner> and callRemote(methname) looks in that default interface before
looking anywhere else
<warner> for some reason I want to get rid of the stringyness of the method
name
<warner> and the original syntax (callRemoteInterface('RIFoo', 'methname',
args)) felt too verbose
<radix> warner: well, isn't that what your optional .meth thing is for?
<radix> yes, I don't like that either
<warner> using callRemote(RIFoo.bar, args) means I can just switch on the
_name= argument being either a string or a (whatever) that's contained in a
RemoteInterface
<warner> a lot of it comes down to how adapters would be most useful when
dealing with remote objects
<warner> and to what extent remote interfaces should be interchangeable with
local ones
<radix> good point. I have never had a use case where I wanted to adapt a
remote object, I don't think
<radix> however, I have had use cases to send interfaces across the wire
<radix> e.g. having a parameterized portal.login() interface
<warner> that'll be different, just callRemote('foo', RIFoo)
<radix> yeah.
<warner> the current issue is whether to pass them by reference or by value
<radix> eugh
<radix> Can you explain it without using those words? :)
<warner> hmm
<radix> Do you mean, Referenceable style vs Copyable style?
<warner> at the moment, when you send a Referenceable across the wire, the
id-number is accompanied with a list of strings that designate which
RemoteInterfaces the original claims to provide
<warner> the receiving end looks up each string in a local table, and
populates the RemoteReference with a list of RemoteInterface classes
<warner> the table is populated by metaclass magic that runs when a 'class
RIFoo(RemoteInterface)' definition is complete
<radix> ok
<radix> so a RemoteInterface is simply serialized as its qual(), right?
<warner> so as long as both sides include the same RIFoo definition, they'll
wind up with compatible remote interfaces, defining the same method names,
same method schemas, etc
<warner> effectively
<warner> you can't just send a RemoteInterface across the wire right now, but
it would be easy to add
<warner> the places where they are used (sending a Referenceable across the
wire) all special case them
<radix> ok, and you're considering actually writing a serializer for them that
sends all the information to totally reconstruct it on the other side without
having the definiton
<warner> yes
<warner> or having some kind of debug method which give you that
<radix> I'd say, do it the way you're doing it now until someone comes up with
a use case for actually sending it...
<warner> right
<warner> the only case I can come up with is some sort of generic object
browser debug tool
<warner> everything else turns into a form of version negotiation which is
better handled elsewhere
<warner> hmm
<warner> so RIFoo(rr).callRemote('bar', **kw)
<warner> I guess that's not too ugly
<radix> That's my vote. :)
<warner> one thing it lacks is the ability to cleanly state that if 'bar'
doesn't exist in RIFoo then it should signal an error
<warner> whereas callRemote(RIFoo.bar, **kw) would give you an AttributeError
before callRemote ever got called
<warner> i.e. "make it impossible to express the incorrect usage"
<radix> mmmh
<radix> warner: but you _can_ check it immediately when it's called
<warner> in the direction I was heading, callRemote(str) would just send the
method request and let the far end deal with it, no schema-checking involved
<radix> warner: which, 99% of the time, is effectively the same time as
IFoo.bar would happen
<warner> whereas callRemote(RIFoo.bar) would indicate that you want schema
checking
<warner> yeah, true
<radix> hm.
<warner> (that last feature is what allowed callRemote and callRemoteInterface
to be merged)
<warner> or, I could say that the normal RemoteReference is "untyped" and does
not do schema checking
<warner> but adapting one to a RemoteInterface results in a
TypedRemoteReference which does do schema checking
<warner> and which refuses to be invoked with method names that are not in the
schema
<radix> warner: we-ell
<radix> warner: doing method existence checking is cool
<radix> warner: but I think tying any further "schema checking" to adaptation
is a bad idea
<warner> yeah, that's my hunch too
<warner> which is why I'd rather not use adapters to express the scope of the
method name (which RemoteInterface it is supposed to be a part of)
<radix> warner: well, I don't think tying it to callRemote(RIFoo.methName)
would be a good idea just the same
<warner> hm
<warner> so that leaves rr.callRemote(RIFoo['add']) and
rr.callRemoteInterface(RIFoo, 'add')
<radix> OTOH, I'm inclined to think schema checking should happen by default
<radix> It's just a the matter of where it's parameterized
<warner> yeah, it's just that the "default" case (rr.callRemote('name')) needs
to work when there aren't any RemoteInterfaces declared
<radix> warner: oh
<warner> but if we want to encourage people to use the schemas, then we need
to make that case simple and concise
* radix goes over the issue in his head again
<radix> Yes, I think I still have the same position.
<warner> which one? :)
<radix> IFoo(rr).callRemote("foo"); which would do schema checking because
schema checking is on by default when it's possible
<warner> using an adaptation-like construct to declare a scope of the method
name that comes later
<radix> well, it _is_ adaptation, I think.
<radix> Adaptation always has plugged in behavior, we're just adding a bit
more :)
<warner> heh
<warner> it is a narrowing of capability
<radix> hmm, how do you mean?
<warner> rr.callRemote("foo") will do the same thing
<warner> but rr.callRemote("foo") can be used without the remote interfaces
<radix> I think I lost you.
<warner> if rr has any RIs defined, it will try to use them (and therefore
complain if "foo" does not exist in any of them, or if the schema is violated)
<radix> Oh. That's strange.
<radix> So it's really quite different from how interfaces regularly work...
<warner> yeah
<warner> except that if you were feeling clever you could use them the normal
way
<radix> Well, my inclination is to make them work as similarly as possible.
<warner> "I have a remote reference to something that implements RIFoo, but I
want to use it in some other way"
<radix> s/possible/practical/
<warner> then IBar(rr) or RIBar(rr) would wrap rr in something that knows how
to translate Bar methods into RIFoo remote methods
<radix> Maybe it's not practical to make them very similar.
<radix> I see.

rr.callRemote(RIFoo.add, **kw)
rr.callRemote(RIFoo['add'], **kw)
RIFoo(rr).callRemote('add', **kw)

I like the second one. Normal Interfaces behave like a dict, so IFoo['add']
gets you the method-describing object (z.i.i.Method). My RemoteInterfaces
don't do that right now (because I remove the attributes before handing the
RI to z.i), but I could probably fix that. I could either add attributes to
the Method or hook __getitem__ to return something other than a Method
(maybe a RemoteMethodSchema).

Those Method objects have a .getSignatureInfo() which provides almost
everything I need to construct the RemoteMethodSchema. Perhaps I should
post-process Methods rather than pre-process the RemoteInterface. I can't
tell how to use the return value trick, and it looks like the function may
be discarded entirely once the Method is created, so this approach may not
work.

On the server side (Referenceable), subclassing Interface is nice because it
provides adapters and implements() queries.

On the client side (RemoteReference), subclassing Interface is a hassle: I
don't think adapters are as useful, but getting at a method (as an attribute
of the RI) is important. We have to bypass most of Interface to parse the
method definitions differently.

* create UnslicerRegistry, registerUnslicer

consider adopting the existing collection API (getChild, putChild) for this,
or maybe allow registerUnslicer() to take a callable which behaves kind of
like a twisted.web isLeaf=1 resource (stop walking the tree, give all index
tokens to the isLeaf=1 node)

also some APIs to get a list of everything in the registry

* use metaclass to auto-register RemoteCopy classes

** use metaclass to auto-register Unslicer classes

** and maybe Slicer classes too

 class FailureSlicer(slicer.BaseSlicer):
     classname = "twisted.python.failure.Failure"
     slicerForClasses = (failure.Failure,) # triggers auto-register

** various registry approaches

There are currently three kinds of registries used in banana/newpb:

 RemoteInterface <-> interface name
 class/type -> Slicer (-> opentype) -> Unslicer (-> class/type)
 Copyable subclass -> copyable-opentype -> RemoteCopy subclass

There are two basic approaches to representing the mappings that these
registries implement. The first is implicit, where the local objects are
subclassed from Sliceable or Copyable or RemoteInterface and have attributes
to define the wire-side strings that represent them. On the receiving side,
we make extensive use of metaclasses to perform automatic registration
(taking names from class attributes and mapping them to the factory or
RemoteInterface used to create the remote version).

The second approach is explicit, where pb.registerRemoteInterface,
pb.registerRemoteCopy, and pb.registerUnslicer are used to establish the
receiving-side mapping. There isn't a clean way to do it explicitly on the
sending side, since we already have instances whose classes can give us
whatever information we want.

The advantage of implicit is simplicity: no more questions about why my
pb.RemoteCopy is giving "not unserializable" errors. The mere act of
importing a module is enough to let PB create instances of its classes.

The advantage of doing it explicitly is to remind the user about the
existence of those maps, because the factory classes in the receiving map is
precisely equal to the user's exposure (from a security point of view). See
the E paper on secure-serialization for some useful concepts.

A disadvantage of implicit is that you can't quite be sure what, exactly,
you're exposed to: the registrations take place all over the place.

To make explicit not so painful, we can use quotient's .wsv files
(whitespace-separated values) which map from class to string and back again.
The file could list fully-qualified classname, wire-side string, and
receiving factory class on each line. The Broker (or rather the RootSlicer
and RootUnslicer) would be given a set of .wsv files to define their
mapping. It would get all the registrations at once (instead of having them
scattered about). They could also demand-load the receive-side factory
classes.

For now, go implicit. Put off the decision until we have some more
experience with using newpb.

* move from VocabSlicer sequence to ADDVOCAB/DELVOCAB tokens

Requires a .wantVocabString flag in the parser, which is kind of icky but
fixes the annoying asymmetry between set (vocab sequence) and get (VOCAB
token). Might want a CLEARVOCAB token too.

On second thought, this won't work. There isn't room for both a vocab number
and a variable-length string in a single token. It must be an open sequence.
However, it could be an add/del/set-vocab sequence, allowing the vocab to be
modified incrementally.

** VOCABize interface/method names

One possibility is to make a list of all strings used by all known
RemoteInterfaces and all their methods, then send it at broker connection
time as the initial vocab map. A better one (maybe) is to somehow track what
we send and add a word to the vocab once we've sent it more than three
times.

Maybe vocabize the pairs, as "ri/name1","ri/name2", etc, or maybe do them
separately. Should do some handwaving math to figure out which is better.

* nail down some useful schema syntaxes

This has two parts: parsing something like a __schema__ class attribute (see
the sketches in schema.xhtml) into a tree of FooConstraint objects, and
deciding how to retrieve schemas at runtime from things like the object being
serialized or the object being called from afar. To be most useful, the
syntax needs to mesh nicely (read "is identical to") things like formless and
(maybe?) atop or whatever has replaced the high-density highly-structured
save-to-disk scheme that twisted.world used to do.

Some lingering questions in this area:

 When an object has a remotely-invokable method, where does the appropriate
 MethodConstraint come from? Some possibilities:

  an attribute of the method itself: obj.method.__schema__

  from inside a __schema__ attribute of the object's class

  from inside a __schema__ attribute of an Interface (which?) that the object
  implements

 Likewise, when a caller holding a RemoteReference invokes a method on it, it
 would be nice to enforce a schema on the arguments they are sending to the
 far end ("be conservative in what you send"). Where should this schema come
 from? It is likely that the sender only knows an Interface for their
 RemoteReference.

 When PB determines that an object wants to be copied by value instead of by
 reference (pb.Copyable subclass, Copyable(obj), schema says so), where
 should it find a schema to define what exactly gets copied over? A class
 attribute of the object's class would make sense: most objects would do
 this, some could override jellyFor to get more control, and others could
 override something else to push a new Slicer on the stack and do streaming
 serialization. Whatever the approach, it needs to be paralleled by the
 receiving side's unjellyableRegistry.

* RemoteInterface instances should have an "RI-" prefix instead of "I-"

DONE

* merge my RemoteInterface syntax with zope.interface's

I hacked up a syntax for how method definitions are parsed in
RemoteInterface objects. That syntax isn't compatible with the one
zope.interface uses for local methods, so I just delete them from the
attribute dictionary to avoid causing z.i indigestion. It would be nice if
they were compatible so I didn't have to do that. This basically translates
into identifying the nifty extra flags (like priority classes, no-response)
that we want on these methods and finding a z.i-compatible way to implement
them. It also means thinking of SOAP/XML-RPC schemas and having a syntax
that can represent everything at once.


* use adapters to enable pass-by-reference or pass-by-value

It should be possible to pass a reference with variable forms:

 rr.callRemote("foo", 1, Reference(obj))
 rr.callRemote("bar", 2, Copy(obj))

This should probably adapt the object to IReferenceable or ICopyable, which
are like ISliceable except they can pass the object by reference or by
value. The slicing process should be:

 look up the type() in a table: this handles all basic types
 else adapt the object to ISliceable, use the result
 else raise an Unsliceable exception
  (and point the user to the docs on how to fix it)

The adapter returned by IReferenceable or ICopyable should implement
ISliceable, so no further adaptation will be done.

* remove 'copy' prefix from remotecopy banana type names?

<glyph> warner: did we ever finish our conversation on the usefulness of the
(copy foo blah) namespace rather than just (foo blah)?
<warner> glyph: no, I don't think we did
<glyph> warner: do you still have (copy foo blah)?
<warner> glyph: yup
<warner> so far, it seems to make some things easier
<warner> glyph: the sender can subclass pb.Copyable and not write any new
code, while the receiver can write an Unslicer and do a registerRemoteCopy
<warner> glyph: instead of the sender writing a whole slicer and the receiver
registering at the top-level
<glyph> warner: aah
<warner> glyph: although the fact that it's easier that way may be an artifact
of my sucky registration scheme
<glyph> warner: so the advantage is in avoiding registration of each new
unslicer token?
<glyph> warner: yes. I'm thinking that a metaclass will handily remove the
need for extra junk in the protocol ;)
<warner> well, the real reason is my phobia about namespace purity, of course
<glyph> warner: That's what the dots are for
<warner> but ease of dispatch is also important
<glyph> warner: I'm concerned about it because I consider my use of the same
idiom in the first version of PB to be a serious wart
* warner nods
<warner> I will put together a list of my reasoning
<glyph> warner: I think it's likely that PB implementors in other languages
are going to want to introduce new standard "builtin" types; our "builtins"
shouldn't be limited to python's provided data structures
<moshez> glyph: wait
<warner> ok
<moshez> glyph: are you talking of banana types
<moshez> glyph: or really PB
<warner> in which case (copy blah blah) is a non-builtin type, while
(type-foo) is a builtin type
<glyph> warner: plus, our namespaces are already quite well separated, I can
tell you I will never be declaring new types outside of quotient.* and
twisted.* :)
<warner> moshez: this is mostly banana (or what used to be jelly, really)
<glyph> warner: my inclination is to standardize by convention
<glyph> warner: *.* is a non-builtin type, [~.] is a builtin
<moshez> glyph: ?
<glyph> sorry [^.]*
<glyph> my regular expressions and shell globs are totally confused but you
know what I mean
<glyph> moshez: yes
<moshez> glyph: hrm
<saph_w> glyph: you're making crazy anime faces
<moshez> glyph: why do we need any non-Python builtin types
<glyph> moshez: because I want to destroy SOAP, and doing that means working
with people I don't like
<glyph> moshez: outside of python
<moshez> glyph: I meant, "what specific types"
<moshez> I'd appreciate a blog on that

* have Copyable/RemoteCopy default to __getstate__/__setstate__?

At the moment, the default implementations of getStateToCopy() and
setCopyableState() get and set __dict__ directly. Should the default instead
be to call __getstate__() or __setstate__()?

* make slicer/unslicers for pb.RemoteInterfaces

exarkun's use case requires these Interfaces to be passable by reference
(i.e. by name). It would also be interesting to let them be passed (and
requested!) by value, so you can ask a remote peer exactly what their
objects will respond to (the method names, the argument values, the return
value). This also requires that constraints be serializable.

do this, should be referenceable (round-trip should return the same object),
should use the same registration lookup that RemoteReference(interfacelist)
uses

* investigate decref/Referenceable race

Any object that includes some state when it is first sent across the wire
needs more thought. The far end could drop the last reference (at time t=1)
while a method is still pending that wants to send back the same object. If
the method finishes at time t=2 but the decref isn't received until t=3, the
object will be sent across the wire without the state, and the far end will
receive it for the "first" time without that associated state.

This kind of conserve-bandwidth optimization may be a bad idea. Or there
might be a reasonable way to deal with it (maybe request the state if it
wasn't sent and the recipient needs it, and delay delivery of the object
until the state arrives).

* sketch out how to implement glyph's crazy non-compressed sexpr encoding

* consider a smaller scope for OPEN-counter reference numbers

For newpb, we moved to implicit reference numbers (counting OPEN tags
instead of putting a number in the OPEN tag) because we didn't want to burn
so much bandwidth: it isn't feasible to predict whether your object will
need to be referenced in the future, so you always have to be prepared to
reference it, so we always burn the memory to keep track of them (generally
in a ScopedSlicer subclass). If we used explicit refids then we'd have to
burn the bandwidth too.

The sorta-problem is that these numbers will grow without bound as long as
the connection remains open. After a few hours of sending 100-byte objects
over a 100MB connection, you'll hit 1G-references and will have to start
sending them as LONGINT tokens, which is annoying and slightly verbose (say
3 or 4 bytes of number instead of 1 or 2). You never keep track of that many
actual objects, because the references do not outlive their parent
ScopedSlicer.

The fact that the references themselves are scoped to the ScopedSlicer
suggests that the reference numbers could be too. Each ScopedSlicer would
track the number of OPEN tokens emitted (actually the number of
slicerForObject calls made, except you'd want to use a different method to
make sure that children who return a Slicer themselves don't corrupt the
OPEN count).

This requires careful synchronization between the ScopedSlicers on one end
and the ScopedUnslicers on the other. I suspect it would be slightly
fragile.

One sorta-benefit would be that a somewhat human-readable sexpr-based
encoding would be even more human readable if the reference numbers stayed
small (you could visually correlate objects and references more easily). The
ScopedSlicer's open-parenthesis could be represented with a curly brace or
something, then the refNN number would refer to the NN'th left-paren from
the last left-brace. It would also make it clear that the recipient will not
care about objects outside that scope.
