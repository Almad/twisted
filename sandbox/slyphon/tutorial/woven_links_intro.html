<h1>Woven Links: <i>The Program of your Tutorial</i></h1>
<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
I wrote this program because Mozilla kept losing my bookmarks, and i got tired
of coding the html in my ~/public_html/index.html by hand every time I wanted
to add a link to something. I'd been programming in Python for about two
years, and hanging out in #python on freenode.net, and when someone suggested
using Woven, it seemed like a natural and easy way of creating dynamic web
content.
</p>

<p>
The program we'll be looking at is a bookmark organizer. It organizes the
bookmarks into categories, each category with a descriptive heading, and
presents them in a table. The program makes use of a two panel design, with a
consistent, left-hand-side menu for site navigation.
</p> 

<p>
I turned it into this tutorial both to give something back to the developers,
and because Woven's users seem to be having similar problems to those that I
had while writing this application. One thing that struck me was that the
HowTos are all very well written and informative, but sometimes I found it
difficult to fit all of the pieces together. I hope to be able to weave (no pun
intended) a narrative context around the relevant documentation that exists
already in the <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/">Twisted
HowTos</a>. I'll do my best to link to appropriate topics throughout this document. 
</p>
<p>
I hope, Dear Reader, that you'll find this tutorial useful.
</p>
<p>
And now, on with the show...
</p>

<h2>Running the tutorial</h2>
<p>
In order to run this tutorial, make sure you have met the 
<a href="intro.xhtml#prerequisites">prerequisites</a>. 
</p>
<p>
go to xx-- insert file path here --xx and
type on the command line: 
</p>

<pre class="shell">
    $ twistd -noy RunHome2.py
</pre>

<p>
This will start the server, but won't daemonize so you can see the debugging/logging 
information. Then point your web browser to 
<a href="http://localhost:7000/home">http://localhost:7000/home</a>. 
This will put you on the main links page called '/home'. </p>

<h2>Overview and Structure</h2>
<p>
You'll notice on the left there's a menu with choices to allow the user to go to
the main page, edit the links, or during development and debugging, reload the
application. If you click on the <q>edit</q> link, you'll see the menu remains
on the left, and in the center now is a list of all the links on the main page,
with options to edit or delete any particular link, or to add a new link. If you
click on the <q>rebuild modules</q> link, you'll see a ton of debugging info fly
by in the terminal, and you'll wind up back on the main page. What the program
has just done is reload all the modules that comprise this application so that
changes made in the source code will take effect in the <q>live</q> application
being served by twistd (more on this later).
</p>

<p>
The application has been designed with the model View Controller (which from now on
I'll call MVC) model in mind. The model-specific modules are stored in
'storage/' and are responsible for all communication that happens with the
back-end of the project.  Middle-tier modules that encapsulate the data
returned from the database, are in the 'woven_links/' root folder, as are all
of the Pages. All Page templates, when stored in a separate file are in
'templates/'. 
</p>
-->
<p>
This classes in this application fall into three categories. There are the classes
that handle the back-end data directly, there are classes that wrap that data and
are used as Woven models, and there is the Woven code itself.  
</p>
<p>
First, we're going to take a look at the application code, the part that runs the 
TCPService and answers requests. Then we'll take a look at the page responsible for 
handling the control of program flow. Then we'll look at how the backend supplies the
front end with data. And lastly, we'll explore how to do form submittal, and some of
the common idioms of Woven.
