<H1>HomePage- Where the action is!</H1>
<H2>Overview</H2>
<p>
The main page in this application is HomePage, which pulls double-duty, it's the
main Controller for the application, and it renders the main page for viewing, by 
subclassing SuperPage (which we'll see in the next chapter). For now, we're going
to look at how this Page handles the flow of the program, as this Page is the glue
that holds all of the pieces of the application together.

<H2>Handling requests for child Resources</H2>
<H3>God Bless the wchilds</H3>
<p>
Woven is a framework that makes use of methods with pre-defined signatures that
you write to customize your application, and that the framework knows how to
locate. In woven there is a convention of prefixing these methods with the
letter 'w' (...you can probably guess why). In this code we can see that most
of the action takes place inside of <q>wchild_</q> prefixed methods. When this
application is started, by running twistd -y 
<a href="application.html">RunHome.py</a>, it's given a HomePage instance
that's used as the root of the Resource (document) tree.  When a request is
made for a child document of this application, say 
<a href="http://localhost:7000/edit">http://localhost:7000/edit</a>, woven
looks in HomePage to fill the request. First it looks for a method named
wchild_edit, and if one is not found, it calls the getDynamicChild method to
see if the developer has added some logic to find the appropriate Resource in
there.  </p>
<a href="src/HomePage.py" class="py-listing"></a>

<p>
On the HomePage you can see that we have defined child pages for all of the 
child Resources we wish to make available from this root page. 
</p>

<H3>getDynamicChild() and the default Page</H3>
<p>
When Woven calls getDynamicChild(), the requested page has not been found in 
any of the wchild_'s and it is giving you a chance to make some decisions as to
where you want the user to go to next, and what you wish to accomplish. If we
look at the last statement of the method, we'll see that if the user has requested
a child page below /home that we don't know anything about, we will return an 
error telling them so. 
</p>

<h3>Handling requests and performing tasks using getDynamicChild()</h3>
<p>
One of the goals of this site is to not just to provide access to the bookmarks 
stored in our database, but also to provide us with an interface to manage them with.
The main difficulty anyone faces when writing a web application is that http
is, by definition, a stateless protocol. The server doesn't know anything (without
programmatic help) about who is connecting at any given time. It simply recieves a 
request, checks to make sure it can fill the request, and takes appropriate action. 
This presents us with a bit of a problem when the processing done on one page needs
to hand off a value to the next part of the program. For instance, when someone uses
the <a href="editpage.xhtml">EditPage</a> to select a link they wish to change the 
attributes of, we need some kind of way of passing the user's selection to the 
<a href="editlinkpage.xhtml">EditLinkPage</a>. We're not going to go into the full details
of this here, but rather I just wanted to introduce the idea and explain a little
bit about why these two pages were handled specially.
</p>

<h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
<p>
Now, I realize that people have different styles of learning and absorbing information,
so I'm going to give you an option or two on how to proceed from here. If you're dying
to understand how this web page renders it's information, you can skip ahead to
<a href="superpage.xhtml">The Superpage</a>. If you'd like to understand where
the data comes from and how it is modeled, then the 
<a href="datastore.xhtml">next section</a> will describe the data storage
object interface IDataStore, and it's main implementing class CSVStorage. I'll
also be discussing the related middle-tier objects that encapsulate the rows
returned by the data storage object, and provide us with a more
application-friendly approach to interacting with our data.  </p>
