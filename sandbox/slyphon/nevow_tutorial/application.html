<h1>Our Twisted Application Class - RunHome</h1>

<h2>A Very Simple Server</h2>
<p>
The module RunHome is the engine that makes our application run. Setting up
a web server is very simple in Twisted, and since this example doesn't require
anything too fancy, I'll explain what each line does in the following code without
too much discussion afterwards.

<b>twisted.internet.app is now deprecated!</b>
</p>
<p>I'd originally wrote this little piece using a deprecated module. 
Unfortunately I'm not quite sure where the documentation is for the new module
twisted.application...but I promise to make it available here as soon as the information
becomes available. In the meantime...
