<h1>The EditPage</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This page provides the user a table of all bookmarks in the application, and
allows them to select a bookmark to edit or delete. In the 
<a href="src/templates/edit_page.html">template</a> for this page, we've also
included a link to allow users to add a bookmark.

<a href="src/EditPage.py" class="py-listing"></a>

<h2>wmfactory_db_table</h2>
<p>
Because we've taken the time to build our storage backend the way we did,
we can simplify the model in this Page. The storage object returns a 
BookmarkContainer object (which is basically just a list), with all of the 
Bookmarks stored by the application.

<h2>wvupdate_table_data</h2>
<p>
Here's where the interesting part happens. First we're going to create a new
lmx object <q>wrapped</q> around the node that had the view=<q>table_data</q> 
attribute defined. lmx is a thin wrapper around the w3c's DOM API (because
of it's high suck factor), and allows us to write large amounts HTML from
Python. You can read more about the details of using lmx module in the 
<a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/viewindepth#auto4">View In Depth</a>
howto.
</p>
<p>
First, we sort the table data by category to make it more readable. Then we
create the actual html table. Each bookmark gets an 'edit' and 'delete' link
next to it in the table to allow the user to select the corresponding action.
In the case of an 'edit' link, the root of the url is EditLink, which is the
page we'll use to edit the bookmarks, and the child is the id number of the
bookmark the user wishes to edit. This is where the magic of getDynamicChild()
comes into play.
