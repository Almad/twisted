<h1>Deferreds are beautiful! (A Tutorial)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Deferreds are quite possibly the single most confusing topic that a newcomer to 
Twisted has to deal with. I am going to forgo the normal talk about what deferreds
are, what they aren't, and why they're used in Twisted. Instead, I'm going  show you 
the logic behind what they <b>do</b>.</p>


<p>A deferred allows you to encapsulate the logic that you'd normally use to make a 
series of function calls after receiving a result into a single object. In the 
examples that follow, I'll first show you a non-deferred programmatic example,
then show you the deferred equivalent. All of these examples are runnable code, so
feel free to play around with them.</p>

 
<h2>A simple example</h2>

First, a simple example so that we have something to talk about:
