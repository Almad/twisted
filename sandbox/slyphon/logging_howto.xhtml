<h1>Twisted Logging</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Many people aren't aware, but Twisted provides you with a global logging
facility. If you start your application using twistd, all you need to do to log
messages to the logfile is</p>

<code class="py-listing">
>>> from twisted.python import log
>>> log.msg("I am a log message")
>>>
</code>

<p>However, Twisted's logging facility allows you to do much more. The logging
module is really a global event framework, and it is possible to use it to do 
conditional logging or statistics gathering in large complex applications.</p>

<h2>Log Observers: Big Brother is Watching</h2>

<h3>Log Events</h3>

<p>The logging framework is based on <strong>events</strong>. When you do
<code>log.msg("I am a log msg")</code>, the framework creates a dict that is
sent to a list of registered <strong>observers</strong>.
