  insults is a curses-like module that runs over a socket connected to any
vt102 or vt102-like terminal.

  demo_insults.py draws a bunch of random crap on the screen.  +, -, *, and
/ change the drawing timings.  There is no key to quit.

  demo_recvline.py is a trivial line editor.  It has very basic history
support. It supports printable characters, left, right, up, and down arrows,
backspace, and delete.  Insert will toggle between insert and typeover mode.
Home will move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.  End will
move the cursor to the end of the current line.  Enter will add the line
above the prompt in a small scroll region.  "quit" will reset the terminal
and disconnect.

  demo_drawing.py lets you spew random things onto the terminal.  It
supports all four arrow keys and spacebar to switch between "drawing"
characters.

  demo_manhole.py is like demo_recvline.py, but is hooked up to a Python
interpreter.

  stdio.py is like manhole.py, but is hooked up to stdin instead of a
socket.

  All demos listen on two ports, 6022 for ssh and 6023 for telnet.  The
telnet server requires no login.  The credentials for the ssh server are
username / password.  No terminal cleanup can be performed in the event of
abnormal disconnection, so, except in the case of issuing "quit" to
demo_recvline.py, you will probably need to reset after you disconnect.
