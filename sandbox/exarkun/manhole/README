  insults is a curses-like module that runs over a socket connected to any
vt102 or vt102-like terminal.

  demo_insults.py draws a bunch of random crap on the screen.  +, -, *, and
/ change the drawing timings.  There is no key to quit.

  demo_recvline.py is a trivial line editor.  It does not support histories. 
It does support printable characters, left and right arrow, backspace, and
C-d for delete (if you can tell me why the delete key doesn't work, I'd love
to fix it).  Enter will add the line below the prompt (where you probably
cannot see it).

  demo_drawing.py lets you spew random things onto the terminal.  It
supports all four arrow keys and spacebar to switch between "drawing"
characters.

  All demos listen on two ports, 6022 for ssh and 6023 for telnet.  The
telnet server requires no login.  The credentials for the ssh server are
username / password.  No terminal cleanup is performed, so you will probably
need to reset after you disconnect.
