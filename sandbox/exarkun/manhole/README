  insults is a curses-like module that runs over a socket connected to any
vt102 or vt102-like terminal.

  demo_insults.py draws a bunch of random crap on the screen.  +, -, *, and
/ change the drawing timings.  There is no key to quit.

  demo_recvline.py is a trivial line editor.  It has very basic history
support. It supports printable characters, left, right, up, and down arrows,
backspace, and delete.  Enter will add the line above the prompt in a small
scroll region.

  demo_drawing.py lets you spew random things onto the terminal.  It
supports all four arrow keys and spacebar to switch between "drawing"
characters.

  All demos listen on two ports, 6022 for ssh and 6023 for telnet.  The
telnet server requires no login.  The credentials for the ssh server are
username / password.  No terminal cleanup is performed, so you will probably
need to reset after you disconnect.
