---Async---

Existing docs: 

 - the defer.xhtml howto needs to become the "more on deferreds" howto, with
   simple deferred info moving to async.xhtml

New docs:

 - the async.xhtml discussion of what Deferreds can't do calls for an answer to
   the question "well... if /Deferreds/ don't make my function non-blocking,
   how /can/ I make them non-blocking?" guide.
