Existing docs: 

 - defer.xhtml needs to be turned into the complete reference to /using/
   returned Deferreds.

 - gendefer.xhtml needs to be turned into the complete reference to /making/
   Deferreds (it's in a much worse state than defer.xhtml)

 - the deferred tutorial (by slyphun) should be mined for the above if possible
