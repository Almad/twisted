This directory contains Twisted-specific extensions to zpkgtools (and
maybe some general purpose extensions, as well, which will hopefully
be integrated into mainline zpkgtools eventually).


EXTENSIONS.cfg: This is a new configuration file that you can put in
your packages that contains python code that creates an 'extensions'
list, full of Distutils Extension instances. Its namespace has
'builder' and 'Extension' defined. 'builder' is the instance of
zpkgsupport.build_ext_twisted, and 'Extension' is the distutils
Extension classe.

NOTE! When specifying the filename for the C files, make sure that the
path includes the directory name *as included in a zpkg-generated
tarball*, i.e., twisted's zpkg tarball contains "twisted/", so saying
"twisted/protocols/_c_urlarg.c" is fine (as per usual), but
twisted.runner's portmap.c needs to be specified as
"twisted.runner/portmap.c".

Yes, I know this is pretty crappy; hopefully eventually this will be
abstracted out.
