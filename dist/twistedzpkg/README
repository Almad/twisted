This directory contains Twisted-specific extensions to zpkgtools (and
maybe some general purpose extensions, as well, which will hopefully
be integrated into mainline zpkgtools eventually).


EXTENSIONS.cfg: This is a new configuration file that lets you specify
the extension modules your package has, in a flexible way (especially
facilitating conditional compile). You put python code in it that
creates an 'extensions' list, full of Distutils Extension
instances. The config file is evaluated with a namespace containing
'builder' and 'Extension'. 'builder' is the instance of
zpkgsupport.build_ext_twisted, and 'Extension' is the distutils
Extension classe.

NOTE! When specifying the filename for the C files, make sure that the
path includes the directory name *as included in a zpkg-generated
tarball*, i.e., twisted's zpkg tarball contains "twisted/", so saying
"twisted/protocols/_c_urlarg.c" is fine (as per usual), but
twisted.runner's portmap.c needs to be specified as
"twisted.runner/portmap.c".

Yes, I know this is pretty crappy; hopefully eventually this will be
abstracted out.
