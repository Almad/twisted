 - Changed twisted.enterprise.adabi so operations can accept lists
   of arguments. This allows us to use the database adaptor's native
   SQL quoting ability instead of either doing it ourselves, or the
   *current* way twisted does it (not doing it at all, AFAICT!).
   
       cursor.execute("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (%s, %d), "it's magic", 12)
   
   Problem is that different adaptors may have different codes for
   quoting.
   
 - First go at database for twisted.bugs. I hate RDBMS. I hate web.
