* Extension module configuration for sub-packages.

  The idea is to have EXTENSIONS.cfg in each subpackage; it would have
  python code that constructs a list of Extensions in 'extensions',
  perhaps conditionally. This is not working because it seems that
  it'd require deep changes to zpkgtools.

* docs. I'm thinking we should move them into twisted/*/doc, as we
  seem to be going that way for other stuff, and it would make
  packaging in zpkg easier. bin/ too.

* unit tests for zpkg usage...? I want to make sure stuff like
  extensions get build, and docs get included, but exarkun hates
  non-specific tests.

* finish refactoring/rewriting release-twisted to support releasing of
  all of our packages

* Poke Martin to release PyOpenSSL when 2.0 is almost out.
