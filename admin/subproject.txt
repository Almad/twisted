To release a Twisted subproject, all you need to do is run the
following command (assuming the project name is "Foo"):

./admin/release-twisted --commands=exportTemp,makeDocFoo,makeBallFoo

This assumes that the Foo project has already been set up to be a
Twisted subproject, of course. If you're creating a new one, there are
few things that must be done.

To just get it to work with release-twisted, you only need to add the
short package name to the twisted.python.dist.subprojects list.

To make it installable, you need to have a twisted/foo/topfiles
directory that contains a setup.py. Copy it from one of the other
projects, like twisted/conch/topfiles.py. If your subproject has
extension modules, see twisted/runner/topfiles/setup.py as an example.
