= RELEASING TWISTED CORE OR A SUBPROJECT =

0. Fix all release-critical bugs in http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/

1. Verify that buildbot ( http://twistedmatrix.com/buildbot/ ) is ALL
   GREEN (for all platforms that it was green for on the last
   release).

2. svn up.

3. Write release notes in proj/topfiles/NEWS, including a date and a
   version number.

4. Branch the repo to /branches/releases/<a.b>.x. That last 'x' is
   literal.

5. Switch to that branch.

6. Run ./admin/change-versions. Specify the versions of whatever
   you're releasing. Core should be versioned as release.major.minor,
   where minors are only bugfixes, majors are functionality
   increases, and releases are major milestones.

7. Run the release script: 
   ./admin/release-twisted --commands=exportTemp,makeDocProj,makeBallProj

8. Test the produced tarballs. Install them, run tests, etc.

9. svn commit

10. Tag the release.

   svn cp -m 'Tagging for 0.2.0 release' $TREPO/branches/<a.b>.x \
             $TREPO/tags/releases/<a.b.c>.

11. Distribute, announce, and so forth.


= RELEASING TWISTED SUMO =

1. From Twisted trunk WC, mkdir twistedballs

2. Put all current subproject tarballs into twistedballs
   This step is REALLY tedious. Should figure out a better way to do this.

3. Put ZopeInterface-*.tgz in twistedballs

4. ./admin/change-versions, and make sure all the versions are
   appropriately specified for the tarballs you've included.

5. './admin/release-twisted --commands=makeBallSumo --sumo-version=a.b.x.y'
   where 'a.b.x' is the version of Twisted Core contained in this
   release (see point 6 in "Releasing Core or a Subproject" above),
   and 'y' is simply a monotonically increasing nonnegative integer as
   long as 'a.b.x' is the same as the last release.

6. Distribute, announce, etc.

= CREATING A NEW SUBPROJECT =

1. Add project name to twisted/python/dist.py, 'subprojects' list.

2. mkdir twisted/<proj>/topfiles

3. Create a setup.py, copying/modifying from
   e.g. twisted/conch/topfiles/setup.py.

4. If your project has extension modules, see
   twisted/runner/topfiles/setup.py as an example.
