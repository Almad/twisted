= RELEASING TWISTED CORE OR A SUBPROJECT =

0. Fix all release-critical bugs in http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/

1. Verify that buildbot ( http://twistedmatrix.com/buildbot/ ) is ALL
   GREEN (for all platforms that it was green for on the last
   release).

2. svn up.

3. Write release notes in proj/topfiles/NEWS, including a date and a
   version number.

4. Branch the repo to /branches/releases/<a.b>.x. That last 'x' is
   literal.

5. Switch to that branch.

6. Run ./admin/change-versions. Specify the versions of whatever
   you're releasing.

7. Run the release script: 
   ./admin/release-twisted --commands=exportTemp,makeDocProj,makeBallProj

8. Test the produced tarballs. Install them, run tests, etc.

9. svn commit

10. Tag the release.

   svn cp -m 'Tagging for 0.2.0 release' $TREPO/branches/<a.b>.x \
             $TREPO/tags/releases/<a.b.c>.

11. Distribute, announce, and so forth.

= CREATING A NEW SUBPROJECT =

1. Add project name to twisted/python/dist.py, 'subprojects' list.
