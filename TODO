I attempted to categorize these roughly in order of importance, with easier
things towards the top.  Items with names in [[brackets]] before them are being
actively attacked.  Numbering is sequential.

If you want to add an item, or register to be responsable for or help with one
of these items, please discuss it on the mailing list
(http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python), don't edit
this file directly.

--- TO DO:

000 Documentation.  Let's not let this project become Zope.  Anybody with free
    time, please document API calls, write tutorials, and generally figure out
    how this stuff works.

    Specifically weak documentation subsections include:
      * How to write a complex service for PB
      * Identities/Perspectives/Services (Passport & how to use it)

001 [[Glyph]] Asynchronous Authentication Service.  PB (and similiar) servers
    ought to be able to defer their authentication at least to another PB
    service.  This means that the Authenticator interface has to be revamped to
    use callbacks instead of return values.

002 [[Matt Walker]] Configuration Application.  Twisted needs an interactive
    application for exploring and composing the various types of services that
    are available; mktap is not adequate. (I believe the current plan is to use
    a GTK GUI, but ideally it would be nice to have several versions of this
    app at varying levels of complexity, ranging from the hard-core UNIX nerd's
    GTK app to the light'n'fruity Mac user's web admin page...)

003 [[Paul Swartz]] Integration of TOC and Words.  twisted.protocols.toc ought
    to integrate with twisted.words, so that AIM, IRC, and PB clients can all
    access the same chat "space".

004 [[Moshe Zadka]] Relaying for Twisted.Mail.  Twisted.Mail really ought to be
    a complete sendmail/pop3d/imapd replacement, but currently it's lacking a
    few things.  Those things should be added; relaying is at the top of the
    list but there are other tasks too.

005 Twisted.Internet for Jython.  Although Java lacks the select() call, JDK
    1.4 *does* have an API for doing asynchronous I/O.  Even previous to that
    upgrade, it should be possible to fake it by spawning a bunch of threads.
    I would probably prefer having the bunch-of-threads approach initially
    since old JVMs are all over the place; however, it would certainly be
    higher performance to have it actually using an asyncio API; so I'd like to
    have both eventually.  I would really like to have the Jython Faucet back
    up and running again.

006 [[Sean Riley]] "Enterprise".  Similiar to WebWare's MiddleKit, it would be
    nice to have a library for object-relational interaction.  Better yet that
    such interaction could be event-based rather than dependant upon blocking
    DB APIs.  This is a nastier problem than it sounds like.

007 [[Glyph Lefkowitz]] Web widgetry.  Twisted.Web ought to have a way of
    assembling pages where bits of the pages can be rendered asynchronously
    (for example, from pb requests or fetched from other URLs) but the resource
    author shouldn't have to manually juggle NOT_DONE_YET requests.
    twisted.web.lmx might aid with this.  Put more simply: web application
    pages should be collections of components, not just flat text generators.

008 File Transfer layer for PB.  This would be especially nice for
    twisted.words; having standard a way to transfer "large" (100MB+) packets
    across or in tandem with a PB connection without breaking anything would be
    very good.

009 HEAD and other HTTP subtleties for Twisted.Web.  There are many things in
    the HTTP RFC(s) that Twisted.Web does not do properly and should.  This
    could perhaps be broken out into multiple TODO items.

010 Profiling, and possibly C optimization of, twisted.internet.main loop and
    select calls.  There also needs to be some serious load-testing of Twisted
    in this area to discover its limitations.

011 WEBDAV protocol implementation for twisted.web.  A pluggable infrastructure
    would be best, so you could browse different heirarchies (twisted reality
    objects, etc) and edit them.

012 Twisted.Internet for wxwindows.  This might be a better cross-platform
    toolkit solution than tkinter, especially given how poorly tkinter works on
    MacOS.  (At least wxwindows *plans* to support the mac...)

013 [[Allen Short]] Destroy the sun.

014 Web authentication widget which combines Passport with Web so that
    asynchronous authentication won't bother web pages.

015 Twisted Names, a full replacement for BIND.

016 Web Session Expiry. (30 minutes seems like a reasonable default...
